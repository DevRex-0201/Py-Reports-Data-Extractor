In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì There was a failure at Hull Royal Infirmary to understand the process of implementing Section 5(2) of the Mental Health act 1983 [MHA] (Doctors Holding Power) as well as general uncertainty about its significance and effect. Mollie absconded from the ward whilst apparently under this section. The paperwork for the implementation of this section of the MHA 1983 was in fact not properly completed and hence invalid. Whilst the Hull & East Yorkshire NHS Trust has taken steps to educate doctors about this power, these were only local measures and I believe that all doctors working in England and Wales should be aware of section 5(2) and nurses of their equivalent power pursuant to section 5(4) of the MHA 1983 and that appropriate awareness and training should be given."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Between his arrival in SACU at 18.37 on 10 July 2020 and his being discovered self suspended with a ligature at 17.45 on 11 July 2020 there, Michael was subject to a 3 man unlock. On the morning of 11 July, a Saturday, there were 3 officers on duty on SACU. This did permit his cell to be unlocked for a meal to be delivered and for a cursory one and a half minute conversation with a nurse that fell short, on her evidence, of an actual medical examination. On the afternoon of 11 July there were only one or (briefly) two officers on SACU duty per the staff duty log, albeit, as CCTV footage shows, more officers did attend intermittently for specific tasks. The SACU staff duty log shows only one officer on duty for the whole afternoon to 17.00. In any event medical assessments of Michael were not undertaken at any stage while he was on SACU, the reason being given that he was on three man unlock. It appears that there were never sufficient staff available for a dedicated medical assessment to be undertaken. This notwithstanding that evidence from prison officers and a nurse was that during the course of the afternoon Michale`s presentation had become ú angrier ù and ú bizarre ù . In fact, it is now known, he had been ingesting toxic amounts, an unlicensed drug, he had secreted into the prison (his being detected at reception as plugged led him to SACU). is a highly potent which effects judgement and lowers inhibitions. The jury subsequently concluded that the absence of medical, and mental health, assessments, and the use of the (which was never diagnosed), contributed to the Michael`s death. From 17.00, when patrol state commenced, there was clearly only one officer on duty and present. When she discovered Michael self suspended that officer made a perfectly defensible dynamic assessment, electing not to enter the cell unsupported. She made ready to enter for when back up arrived. In the event, partly because there was another discipline incident unfolding on a different wing, this took 2-3 minutes. There were only 16 prison officers available while on patrol state across the entire prison, and they were already at full stretch, and probably beyond it (the Tactical Resources Unit from Doncaster were en route). The evidence was that without knowing precisely when Michael self-suspended any such delay could not be held, on a balance of probabilities, to have entered the chain of causation death. However, the fact remains that there was a delay consequent to Michael being on a three man unlock but there being only a single officer available on SACU while in patrol state. It is reasonable to conjecture that this could have made the difference between life and death in this case, and the repetition of these circumstances could well do so in future. In your response dated 15 November 2021 to the Regulation 28 report of HM Assistant Coroner James Thompson of 21 September 2021 following the Inquest into the death of Charlie Brian Todd at HMP Durham, you wrote, amongst other things: ú There is clear management oversight of the SACU ù . This is not what the evidence in the instance case showed. Rather, what it made clear was that: 1) the SACU staff log plus CCTV further demonstrated that HMAC Thompson`s point to you that ú officers, including officers not posted to SACU, but covering for a shift, were required to allocate various task between themselves on an ad-hoc basis ù was an ongoing problem, and this appears to be still ongoing; 2) NOMIS record keeping was unhelpfully sparse ( ú you would expect more ù was the evidence of SACU manager); 3) the daily log was under-utilised as a multi-disciplinary tool, and this appears to be ongoing. You also stated: ú I am confident that the staffing levels and supervisory arrangements in place are sufficient to deliver all of the SACU`s regime ù . This, too, is clearly not the case. Staffing levels remain the same. Safeguarding of prisoners is compromised as a consequence. With a three man unlock imposed, there should be three officers available at all times to ensure safety. Staffing levels at HMP Durham should be increased."

The Community Psychiatric Nurse (CPN) attempted to make contact by phone on only 2 occasions and did not speak to Lucy.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Sean Duignan was arrested on the 29th May 2021 and taken to Milton Keynes Police Station where he was detained and released under investigation the next day, Sunday 30th. That seems to have been a likely trigger for Sean to take his own life. The next day he was on leave and went to the Luton Airport Police base where the Southern Armoury was located. He was the Armed Response base sergeant. Sean entered the equipment room, where the manual override keys to the armoury were located in a locked box secured by a PIN. Officer [REDACTED] who were present in the equipment room said Sean appeared startled to find them there. He remained cheerful and engaged in cheeky banter [REDACTED] was of the view that Sean entered so that he could access the armoury key. Sean, discovering his access to the override key was blocked asked one of the officers to second him into the armoury. By chance, it was [REDACTED] who agreed and went with Sean to the armoury. She had been given single access by error systems failure some time previously. Sean applied his armoury and entered his PIN. It failed. [REDACTED] and used her card and PIN. Because she was allowed ì incorrectly ì single access, the door opened and she let Sean in where he retrieved a handgun and ammunition. Had [REDACTED] any other officer at base known that Seans access had been restricted she would not, I am certain, have allowed him entry. There was a serious failure by senior management to effectively and safely manage the South Base Armoury. All the base officers who gave evidence before me told me the armoury system, which they referred to as Chronicle, repeatedly and randomly failed. These multiple failures were, according to [REDACTED] not communicated effectively to her. She agreed that she did not herself make any further detailed enquiry instead relying on her Operational Inspector to manage the issue and/or to feed back as appropriate. The computerised system controlling the access to the armoury at South Base included a number of different parts including the server, the software, the Chronicle system itself, the card readers etc. The system as a whole repeatedly failed. There was no effective ongoing monitoring of the system. CI Rowley Smith agreed that the system did not work properly and the monitoring system did not work properly. As part of a fail safe to ensure that officers who needed weapons could obtain them if the computerised system failed, an armoury override key was kept in a locked box, secured by a PIN, in the equipment room. All officers giving evidence before me agreed that the PIN number was common knowledge. The fact that the PIN number was common knowledge meant potentially that any one of the officers working at the base had unfettered access to the armoury [REDACTED]. The fact that the access was not abused by the officers was due wholly to their trustworthiness and professionalism. On this occasion, Sean sought access to the armoury via the key but was thwarted by both PC being present in the equipment room. Unfettered access to the armoury meant that rogue officers (of whom luckily there were none) could potentially have had access to weapons for the purposes of criminality, suicide (as in Seans case) or homicide. Overall, I find the lax approach to safety and security in the South Base armoury by senior management, who were responsible, to be extraordinary. [REDACTED] agreed that the armoury was an unsafe environment. In the interval between Seans death and the Inquest some 18 months later, I was not reassured that effective action had been taken to secure the armoury. Immediately post Inquest some reassurance was provided but gaps remained."

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. The ELFT serious incident (SI) review report identified that, although Mr Largin was discharged to the Woodberry Wetlands neighbourhood rehabilitation team from the crisis (i.e. home treatment) team on 25 January 2022, the neighbourhood team did not allocate him to a team member until 3 February. 2. The report also identified that, despite receiving an email from the Homerton University Hospital community rehabilitation team on 2 February, saying that Mr Largin had been seen on 1 February and was still very depressed, the crisis team failed to reassess him or to re-open his case to the crisis team, but instead referred the community team to the neighbourhood team. 3. However, the SI report did not identify that the crisis team member who made the decision on 2 February simply to advise that Mr Largin should be dealt with by the neighbourhood team failed to record any reasons for her decision. 4. The SI reviewer giving evidence in court said that the SI reviewing team had not even spoken to that crisis team member as part of their investigation, let alone fed back to her. 5. He said they did not at the time realise that she still worked for ELFT, though he accepted that it would have been an extremely straight forward matter to find out. The crisis team members manager gave evidence that she thought the relevant decision maker had left the team before Mr Largins death, so between 3 and 6 February 2022. When I invited that manager to make a call while the inquest was ongoing to check, she later told me that the team member had not left the crisis team until 29 April 2022. 6. It is believed, I was told, that there was a hot de-brief after Mr Largins death. However, no notes were made of that and no entry was made on Mr Largins medical record. 7. Thus, nobody from ELFT found out what the decision makers thinking had been, or what misconceptions she might have had that other staff members might share. The former crisis team member who made the decision still works for ELFT. As far as I could ascertain, her decision making concerning Mr Largin has never been discussed with her by ELFT managers. 8. The SI review also did not identify that members of the crisis team and the neighbourhood team did not share an understanding of how quickly the neighbourhood team aims to make contact with patients, to assist in their decision making about the correct pathway for a patient. In fact, a member of the neighbourhood team itself gave evidence about the response times that, I was told later, was not correct. 9. Finally, the operations lead for the neighbourhood team had great difficulty in giving me clear evidence about whether his team would or could refer a patient back to the crisis team if they felt the circumstances warranted. He demonstrated a lack of clarity on the point that I found very concerning."

His diagnosed conditions of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder required care tailored to his neurodiverse needs. Concern was expressed by two Consultant Psychiatrists who cared for him in life, and the Court appointed Expert Consultant Psychiatrist, regarding the lack of consideration for those with neurodiverse conditions in the care options available, and the lack of availability of appropriate therapies; ì Inpatient mental health units adversely affect those with neurodiverse conditions since they require calm and structure. There are no inpatient options tailored to patients with neurodiverse conditions presenting in acute crisis; ì Home Treatment Teams do not offer continuity of staff or set appointment times, as they are a crisis team allocated according to demand. This stability is required by those suffering from ASD; ì There is a lack of availability of psychological interventions, being the main treatment for neurodiverse conditions, including art therapy, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) and Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) (Zachary was placed on a waiting list) Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to address the above concerns."
https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/samantha-boazman-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2023-0034,31/01/2023,Inmind Healthcare Group," During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. Emergency Response I heard during the course of the inquest that when an alarm sounded staff would attend the location of the alarm, assess the situation and then go and collect what equipment may be necessary to deal with the emergency. At the time of Samanthas death there was only 1 emergency bag for the entire hospital (which had 2 wards and separate self-contained flats on the site). This has now been rectified and there is an emergency bag for every ward. Staff partake in a drill and evidence provided to me for the purposes of Regulation 28 showed that response times of staff remain at 2 minutes to a patients side. However, I was told that the emergency response still has staff attend a patient, assess and then go and collect the emergency bag, rather than taking it immediately to the patients side. I was provided with evidence for the purposes of Regulation 28 by Inmind Healthcare Group which showed, for example, that in December of 2022 there were 64 incidents, 45 of which were self-harm, 2 of which were clinical incidents. 16 resulted in actual harm and a large number of those incidents concerned patients ligating. To continue with an emergency response which delays the provision of life saving equipment to the patients side is unsafe and in my opinion could lead to future deaths. The delay in providing CPR to Samantha on balance had no causative effect on her death, but it could for another patient. 2. Observation Policy At the time of Samanthas death observations were conducted and recorded in a predictable and prescriptive way by healthcare staff. The quality of observations recorded at the time of Samanthas death were such that they did not accord with the expectation of the policy and merely recorded where the patient was and what they were doing. Effective observations were acknowledged as being a vital tool to assess and manage the risk of a patient. Inmind Healthcare Groups new observation Policy states: Observations are a therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing factors which contribute to increased risk and promoting recovery. The use of enhanced observation levels should never be regarded as routine practice¶¶. Observation practice must focus on engaging the person therapeutically and enabling them to address their difficulties constructively. Our interactions must seek to create rapport which allows those in our care to feel valued and safe to share their experiences with us. Since Samanthas death changes have been made by Inmind Healthcare Group to their policy and practice, in that observations are now recorded at the precise time they are conducted and are infrequent in their predictability (eg: hourly observation should be conducted once hourly rather than on the hour every hour). Evidence of recent observation records demonstrated that this was now practice. However, there was a disconnect between the new policy and the pre-printed forms being used to record observations; what staff were being instructed to do and what they were recording. This was confusing and the evidence produced did not support the expectations of the new policy or demonstrate it had become embedded practice. The evidence produced did not support a change in staff recording quality observations, so that whilst precise and intermittent timings were evidenced, beyond the location of the patient or what they were doing, the actual presentation of the patient was not being recorded."

Chief Executive of Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust,"CORONERS CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN in relation to on-line prescribing are as follows: (1) Whilst each individual pharmacy had in-house safety checks to safeguard against over¬≠ prescribing by their own pharmacy, there is no integrated system in place which would alert a prescriber to prescriptions that have been dispensed by other on-line pharmacies. As a result, it is currently possible for a patient to obtain excessive quantities of medication by simply placing multiple orders with different on-line pharmacists. (2) There is no requirement for the on-line pharmacies to share information with the patients GP. This means that, in the absence of the patients consent to share information, the online prescriber is reliant on the accuracy and truthfulness of the history provided by the patient. (3) Lack of information sharing also creates a risk that a GP or Pharmacist Prescriber may unwittingly prescribe a medication that is contraindicated with a medication that has been dispensed through an on-line pharmacy. The MATTERS OF CONCERN in relation to the provision of mental health care on Griffin Ward are as follows: (1) The Recovery & Discharge Plans contained inaccurate information regarding Anias consent to share information with her mother. The evidence was that this was an entry made in error in June 2020 and was not picked up by any of the nurses who updated the Recovery & Discharge Plan over the subsequent 11 months. (2) The Recovery & Discharge Plans did not address the risks associated with Anias procurement of Propranolol from on-line pharmacies. The evidence was that an update of the Recovery & Discharge Plan involved members of nursing staff simply adding a note that the overdoses had taken place. The Plan did not show that any meaningful thought had been given to addressing the particular risk associated with the procurement of on-line medication. (3) Mandatory refresher training on basic aspects of nursing care such as record keeping, searches, care-planning, undertaking pre- and post-leave assessments and confidentiality is not provided to staff. (4) There is no requirement for the outcome of negative personal searches to be documented in the records and consequently there is no ability to effectively audit whether searches are taking place and the treating team are unable to assess a patients level of compliance with rules around bringing contraband items onto the ward. (5) Searches undertaken of Anias room following the overdoses on 10 March and 5 June 2021 were ineffective and did not uncover the Propranolol that Ania had been stockpiling. (6) Documentation on which 1:5 observations are recorded does not evidence that a check has taken place every 5 minutes. Instead the current documentation, simply requires one signature per hour. There is therefore no mechanism by which observations can be effectively audited. (7) There is no requirement to make a separate entry evidencing that a post-leave assessment has been undertaking. The post-leave assessments are currently subsumed within Day Notes and do not clearly state whether an assessment was undertaken, what was discussed and the outcome of the assessment."

Before he was employed as a proof assistant testing new guns, Mr Roberts prospective employer asked for a DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) certificate. This was provided and recorded no convictions, cautions, reprimands or warnings. However, Mr Roberts had in the past been convicted of a violent offence for which he had received a custodial sentence. This was the reason for his dismissal from his former occupation as a police officer in the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service). If Mr Roberts DBS certificate had correctly recorded his conviction, he would not have been employed at Proof House where he had access to firearms. It is unclear to me whether the inaccuracy of the DBS certificate was caused by an error made by the DBS or by the MPS."

In that time there have been 45 adverse lsotretinion events reported to the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) comprising of 81 psychiatric adverse events, one of which was an attempted suicide.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. During the course of the inquest reference was made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance úAutistic Spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management.ù Published on 28 August 2013 and in particular paragraph 1.1.4 which states that ú Local autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with autism has a case manager or key worker to manage and coordinate treatment, care, support and transition to adult care in line with the NICE guideline on autism in children and young people (covering identification and diagnosis). ù Stefan did not have a case manager or key worker. 2. I am unable to say if the lack of a case manager or key worker caused or contributed more than minimally to Stefans death but had one been available they may have been able to assist Stefan and his family to navigate the services available which in turn may have led to intervention which may have made a difference. I am prohibited from returning a conclusion which comments on issues where there is no clear causal link with the death however the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 creates a duty on Coroners to report an issue which gives rise to a concern which may lead to future deaths. 3. I asked for further evidence on the provision of case managers/key workers in accordance with the NICE guidance after the inquest from North East London Foundation Trust and from Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board. It is clear from the evidence provided that such a service is only provided to those under 19 year olds who have both a learning disability and/or a diagnosis of autism and are at risk of admission to a mental health hospital or where there is a significant sudden deterioration in the community and the multi disciplinary team has not been responsive. The lowest level of service outlined in reply to the court indicated that referrals could be made to a key worker to sign post families not that they would have a key worker allocated to them. This sets the bar at a level which means a large number of young people with a learning disability and/or autism would not have a key worker nor would they be expected to have one. 4. In the evidence provided it was outlined that úKeyworkers will make sure that these children, young people and families get the right support at the right time. They will make sure that local systems are responsive to fully meeting the young peoples needs in a joined-up way and that whenever it is possible to provide care and treatment in the community with the right support this becomes the norm.ù If every autistic child or young person had a key worker this would enable them or their family the opportunity to liaise with their key worker rather than having to try to navigate services themselves. This, in turn, may prevent others from encountering the issues faced by Stefans family and ultimately prevent future deaths."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Evidence was heard from police officers from both the Metropolitan Police and Suffolk Constabulary. The officers provided evidence of the details they respectively held regarding the missing person investigation surrounding Anthonys disappearance from London and subsequent death. It was clear that crucial information (that Anthony had a rope in his possession, and a collapsible bicycle providing a secondary form of transport) was not passed between the Metropolitan Police and Suffolk Constabulary. It was heard that there was no set format, or prescribed information requirements to be shared by officers reporting missing persons between one force and another. Investigating officers in the Metropolitan police spoke to the Suffolk Constabulary control room, whose staff logged what they were told onto the CAD record. This information was then relayed to the officers on the ground. Witnesses in this case stated that there is no standardised information sharing requirement or protocol for cross border missing persons investigations (including missing persons with suicidal ideation). I am concerned that, as there is no standardised information sharing requirements or protocols in such cases, in the future a force receiving details of a suicidal missing person may also not be informed that an individual has taken a means of suicide with them. In addition, other important information that may assist in the search for that person may also not be passed."

(1) Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust staff immediate emergency response was not followed: a. pinpoint alarms were not activated immediately on finding Sharon Langley unresponsive b. there was a delay calling the ambulance and basic key information about the type of the emergency was not relayed: i. by qualified nurses who made the 999 calls, or ii. to paramedics on attendance c. there was a delay informing the site co-ordinator of the emergency even though she was based on the ward and there was a lack of co- ordination of the emergency resulting in the ambulance being called a second time by the site co-ordinator d. staff trained in basic life support did not assist the two nurses who were attempting to resuscitate Sharon Langley There was a difference in the safety measures fitted to the bathroom door on the adjoining Stort Ward that had a self-closure mechanism at the time of Sharons death. This mechanism has now been fitted to Chelmer Ward. There is a concern that safety information is not shared across the Trust and known risks are not mitigated appropriately. (3) The Trust was on notice of issues on Chelmer ward with doors to high- risk areas not closing that included the Staff Room and Patient Storeroom. a. At the time of Sharons death, the mitigation on the ward was for staff to push doors to see if they were locked, this was action even though evidence was heard that these doors had keylocks and staff had keys that could have been used. b. The Patient Storeroom contains items removed from patients as they pose a significant self-harm risk and/or suicide. c. Staff Room that contains items that pose a risk to patients Self-closure mechanisms have not been fitted to these doors in a high- risk environment of a secure psychiatric ward even though the risk is known. Evidence was heard from patient safety that it is sufficient to have maintenance manually adjust doors if there are closure issues. (4) Chelmer Ward staff did not always report door closure issues either on the ward to the Nurse in Charge or to maintenance. Following the death of Sharon Langley there has been no training on how to report door closure issues reported. (5) Evidence was heard that the bath plug was required to be kept in the ward office when not in use as the bathroom was a high-risk area. There was no evidence that staff had to obtain this from the office on the day Sharon Langley died. There still appears to be confusion around the requirement. (6) There is concern about the reliability of the Trust investigation and how the Trust learns lessons. The investigation report did not: a. scrutinise the movements of staff even though the door logs were available or raise any issues for further investigation b. raise any issues around the bath plug or where it should be kept c. investigate concerns raised around the Trust staff emergency response or failure to provide basic information on the incident to paramedics (7) The Trust investigation author changed the conclusion of his report during the inquest when he received statements provided by staff that were not requested and contained timing information that in evidence staff stated they did not know. (8) Quality of record keeping was not deemed to be appropriate by senior staff during evidence: a. Significant examples of cut and paste including out-of-date risk information at all grades of ward staff, and omissions in multi-disciplinary decision-making and risk of self-harm with no rationale for the level of observations set for the patient and a plan for how risks should be managed"

(6) A lack of understanding of section 117 Mental Health Act rights and potential for consideration for entitlements to meet Mollys needs related to her mental health disorder, by Essex County Council: a. compelling Molly to choose between family members as part of her discharge planning and then as a consequence changing Mollys status during her detention from homeless. b.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) During the 2¬Ω years in which Charlottes mental health care was provided by the Trust, she had total of 8 different care coordinators. Furthermore, in those 2¬Ω years there was a 5 month period when Charlotte had no appointed care coordinator at all. The care coordinator role is particularly important for a patient with such a complex case history as Charlotte. I heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfil care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trusts own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trusts Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in his evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trusts care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst he was able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, he was unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and was unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence. I am concerned that the Trust is unable to understand fully how the care coordinator system failed at the time of these events, and that it is therefore not in a position to guard against a repeat of these circumstances in the future. (2) The erroneous decision to pause Charlottes referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder was taken by a senior clinician acting on her own, despite a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting having decided that the referral was appropriate. When asked about how the senior clinician could have overridden the MDT decision, the Trusts Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams told the inquest that he could not say whether the senior clinician was not aware of the correct decision-making procedure, or whether she was, but chose instead to ignore it. When asked whether the same issue could arise in future, he told the inquest that he himself would be in a position to prevent the senior clinician making the wrong decision, but could not guarantee that he would be made aware of the issue so as to be able to do so. I am concerned that the Trust has not properly established how the senior clinician was able to override the MDT decision, and does not have a sufficiently robust system in place to ensure that MDT decisions cannot be overridden in this way in future."
https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/jai-singh-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2023-0094,15/03/2023,"Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust, NHS England (Health and Justice), and the Phoenix Partnership (Leeds) Ltd"," During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. A multitude of factors contributed to Mr. Singhs death across the custodial and healthcare teams within HMP Birmingham. Many steps have been taken by all organisations with responsibility for Mr. Singhs safety and health during his time at HMP Birmingham to rectify failings that have been identified such as the consistent failure to use interpreters, poor communication and record keeping within and between teams, the absence of meaningful engagement with Mr. Singhs family, insufficient consideration of family concerns and failings in the use of the ACCT system. 2. Much of the evidence at the inquest focused on the central issue of repeated missed opportunities to identify that Mr. Singh required admission to the prisons inpatient ward, ward 2, and assessment for section 48 transfer to a medium secure unit (which would have been likely to result in transfer to a medium secure unit). The consequences of the failure to transfer Mr. Singh to an inpatient setting were compounded by the fact that he was not taken onto the mental health teams caseload promptly and therefore did not have the benefit of an allocated CPN and the oversight and input of a mental health multi-disciplinary team. Many steps have been undertaken by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (who provide mental health services within the prison) to minimise the risk of such a situation occurring again. 3. However, there are two features of the mental health care provided to Mr. Singh that create a risk to the lives of others that have not yet been rectified: i. the fact that the mental health team multi-disciplinary team (MDT) does not include a psychiatrist; and ii. the absence of any ongoing risk assessment documentation for patients with mental illness within the SystemOne records at HMP Birmingham. 4. In Mr. Singhs case it is my conclusion that it is likely that if a psychiatrist had been at a mental health MDT meeting held on the 19th January 2022 they would have identified that he needed to be admitted to ward 2 without further delay. At the very least the need for urgent review by a psychiatrist and CPN would have been recognised and facilitated which would in turn have led to admission. CPNs in Mr. Singhs case continually failed to identify the significance of repeatedly and consistently reported psychotic symptoms and consequently he did not receive adequate assessment and treatment which increased his risk of self harm and suicide which in turn was not sufficiently identified. The absence of a psychiatrist at the MDT creates a risk that the significance of some symptoms and presentations will not be recognised and further deaths could occur due to lack of appropriate assessment and treatment. 5. Other electronic health care records systems used in mental health settings have a rolling risk assessment document that clinicians are required to review and update at certain points in a patients management. The risk assessment document provides a prompt to clinicians to formally consider risk and come to a reasoned, documented conclusion that then feeds into decision making. The record also provides a reliable, easily accessible source of risk history. No such facility is in use on SystemOne at HMP Birmingham. Further, the evidence given was that such a system is not being used routinely across mental health care within the prison estate and is not provided as standard on SystemOne. This creates an ongoing risk to life arising from under-estimation of risk as a result of clinicians not formally considering and assessing current risk levels, and salient risk history not being easily accessible. It is understood by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust that it should be possible to create a specific risk assessment record within SystemOne and this is being considered locally. However, the evidence given was that this issue should be highlighted nationally and that the developers and distributors of SystemOne should be involved so as to ensure the best available solution is identified."

It has taken the Health Board a considerable amount of time to update and provide the Action Plan, the most recent version still containing outstanding actions and yet Ben died over 2 years ago. It is particularly concerning that learning and actions arising therefrom are not more quickly addressed. If the learning, actions and changes are taking so long then there is a risk that deaths will continue in the interim.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì The Inquest heard evidence from the Head of Service for Safeguarding and Learning for Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. She highlighted a long-standing gap in provision, which was described as extending across most if not all local authorities, for vulnerable adults who have complex needs, but who do not fall into the existing framework of social services, Care Act provision or formal mental health supervision. The effect of that gap is that there is no identifiable individual who is a single point of contact in such cases equivalent to a social worker or care coordinator. The result is that many vulnerable adults with complex needs have no such arrangements in place for contact, collating and sharing of information and deployment of services and assistance, support or safeguarding. Where such arrangements are in place, they are necessarily ad hoc in nature in differing frameworks, levels and standards, and can devolve by default to an individual who, whilst well-motivated, may lack the skills and training to properly perform the function, particularly when the vulnerable adult may be in crisis ."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. The Trust had a shortfall of nursing staff in the Dover and Deal area at the time that Benjamin Hart was under the community mental health team such that although 16 nurses were required to run the service, the Trust only had 8 nurses employed at the time, 2 of whom were long term sick. This left a working complement of 6 nurses to cover the whole area, which required them to take on additional duties. There was no resilience within the team and therefore when the relationship between Ben and his care coordinator broke down there was no capacity within the team to allocate him another care coordinator. Although the Trust has regrouped, reorganised and there has been some limited recruitment the shortfall endures; the evidence given at the inquest being that this is a national issue but it is particularly difficult to recruit within this area of Kent"

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. 5 NHS Trusts and 3 police forces in different geographic areas had contact with Patrick in the final month of his life and each thereby gained some information about the risk to him. However, that information was by reason of the agencies falling into different geographic areas. There was no single effective global focus for the information being acquired piecemeal about Patricks pattern of serious self-harming behaviour. The various agencies were significantly impeded in forming a single clear picture of Patricks pattern of behaviour (which was particularly necessary in circumstances where he was not engaging and therefore not assisting in providing a complete history himself). 2. GPs act as a repository for information about contact with other clinical agencies (such as attendances at accident and emergency departments) and therefore serve as a point of contact for information about past history. However, I heard evidence at inquest from accident and emergency consultants that it is either not possible to access information held by a GP practice out of GP surgery hours or where it is possible to do so that is only available if the GP is in the same geographic area as the accident and emergency department. Several of Patricks attendances at accident and emergency departments were out of GP surgery hours. 3. I was informed at inquest that one local authority (in whose area Patrick resided) had been made aware by police of the risk to Patrick following one of his self- harm incidents (in respect of a particularly important piece of information) and had relayed that information to a 6th NHS Trust (not one of the 5 from which I heard evidence at inquest) but Patrick did not reside in that Trust area. Those Trusts which did have direct contact with Patrick were never made aware of that piece of information nor had any means of accessing it. 4. I heard evidence that there is no national risk flagging system: for example, when a person attends an accident and emergency department having self- harmed, the fact of a previous self-harm attendance at a different accident and emergency department is not systematically flagged up. 5. In summary, there was no single effective global focus consolidating the information which was flowing into the various agencies about Patrick; no global focus to which those agencies could in turn refer in emergency to obtain the totality of information about Patricks recent pattern of behaviour; no national risk flagging system to alert those agencies to his significant recent history."

The information that Miss Henderson had practised tying a ligature was divulged by her at Kingston Hospital but not repeated on admission to the Priory Woking. The evidence given at the inquest was that there is no quick method to obtain NHS records on admission to a private hospital. A request could have been made but the records would have taken over a week to be released. The records were not sought. An ability to obtain the NHS records quickly would have been of assistance to the Priory clinicians. The Priory Woking has a policy in relation to the removal of banned and restricted items but there was a lack of clarity and confusion among the clinicians as to who was responsible for ensuring that such items are identified and removed from the patient at admission.

A failure to ensure that a treatment plan was followed ì observations between 16.00 and 17.00 on the day of Mr Charles death were suspended by the ward shift co-ordinator.

The Datix failed to mention that observations had been suspended by the shift coordinator, a fact that was understood at that time. This obvious and significant piece of information that should have been escalated through the Trust governance team for action. C. The Trust 72 hour report was written by the Modern Matron and was signed-off by an integrated care director on 15th April 2021.

The inquest heard evidence that GMP have guidance to support officers in assessing risk and guiding actions when there is a missing person report. The evidence was that despite the existence of the policy/document the risk was not recognised as being high risk and the appropriate actions were not taken immediately. The evidence indicated that a number of factors were key in this failure to accurately assess the risk. This included: 1. Poor understanding by GMP staff of the fact that a patient detained on a voluntary basis in a mental health ward could still be high risk if they failed to return; 2. Lack of understanding by GMP staff that the use by mental health units of short periods away from the unit to support a patients recovery did not mean a patient could not be high risk if they did not return; 3. Lack of understanding by officers of how to apply the golden hour guidance and what was the expectation in terms of timeliness of undertaking the steps within the guidance coupled with a lack of understanding by some officers of the way/cost to GMP in accessing mobile phone data such as cell site; and 4. Poor quality documentation and information sharing between officers and supervision in relation to information from the family and the mental health unit. The inquest was told that GMP had rolled out an Aide Memoire system to try to embed greater consistency and understanding of the policy across GMP. The Aide Memoires were recognised as being an effective tool. However, there was no evidence available to assist in understanding if the Aide Memoires were being used effectively across the force and how GMP were measuring the implementation of them. Evidence was given to the inquest that GMP have introduced further training on missing persons. However, the effectiveness of that training was unclear given witnesses who had been on the training who gave evidence remained of the view that Rebecca was not a high-risk missing person despite all of the evidence available at the inquest."

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) This inquest highlighted the significant numbers of prisoners who enter the prison system with known or undiagnosed mental health issues. Whilst ACCT 6 requires multidisciplinary attendance at review meetings, this case highlighted the need for specific attendance of an RMN or other mental health expert at any review, (Mr Robinson had repeatedly self harmed prior to committing suicide but had presented without concern at each review which had been carried out without any input from the mental health team). The prison in question now operates a local policy to ensure someone from the mental health team attends all ACCT reviews irrespective of other disciplines attending. This has enabled the prison to identify issues which may not be picked up by other professionals involved, to enable support to be put in place by way of separate care plans which has had a notable impact upon SASH in the prison."

The lack of integrated electronic records between treating team means that important information regarding patient safety is not easily accessible between treating teams. Treating teams are reliant on referral letters which are necessarily limited and not always sufficient to capture all the detailed information available to a referring team. This is particularly concerning where there is dual diagnosis ì such as substance misuse and mental health ì given these are often complex cases. This is particularly the case where complex cases have not been referred into secondary mental health services and so do not have access to a care-coordinator who can oversee and understand the views of the various professionals treating and assisting an individual. I am concerned that the lack of such an integrated electronic system of medical and treatment records inhibits the effective sharing of information regarding patient safety and so increases the risk that information of significance regarding a risk to life will be lost between agencies and not sufficiently understood between all those managing."

There was a lack of full information sharing around risk and joint risk assessment/risk management planning on discharge. 2. Both mental health services were aware that Conrad was accessing aesthetic dermatology treatment. There was a concern that neither service adequately highlighted the risks of accessing such treatment to Conrad or attempted to share information with the skin clinic. The inquest heard that patients with BDD should be fully informed of the risks of seeking aesthetic dermatology treatment and wherever possible, clinics who are providing treatment should be made aware of the BDD diagnosis. 3. The Inquest heard that there is a need for training to be provided to step-down service teams in relation to the diagnosis of BDD and the risks associated with it. 4. The inquest heard that there is a lack of national resources for BDD. The highly specialised service at South London and Maudsley has a very long waiting list (several months). This is on a background of concerns of a likely increase in BDD.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty t report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1) On 4 July 2022 Mr. Harper attended the Emergency Department at Gloucester Royal Hospital, and was seen by a nurse from the Mental Health Liaison team there, who recorded that he was very anxious and distressed, and voicing on going thoughts of suicide. The nurse felt that Mr. Harper would benefit from a period of treatment under the care of the Home Treatment Team, and because Mr. Harper was living in Worcestershire at the time, and because it was now in the early hours of the following day, he called the Worcestershire Crisis Team to arrange that. The nurse concerned was under the impression that by making this phone call, and passing on Mr. Harpers details to the Crisis Team, he was referring Mr. Harpers case to them. He told the inquest that he was expecting mental health services in Worcestershire to arrange a further urgent assessment of Mr. Harper, and he therefore ensured that Mr. Harper was told to expect the Crisis Team to contact him to arrange a further assessment. (2) The Clinical Lead for the Crisis Team in Worcestershire gave evidence to the inquest that whilst the Crisis Team did receive a request from the nurse at Gloucester that night, they interpreted it only as a request for further assessment ( but not an urgent one ), and not as a request that Mr. Harper be referred to the Home Treatment Team. (3) In the event, an urgent assessment was not arranged, and Mr. Harpers case was only considered by the Home Treatment Team in Worcestershire when his temporary GP in Worcestershire, out of further concern for Mr. Harpers mental health, made a new and separate referral to them. (4) I have concluded that the events described above arose out of a lack of understanding between the two NHS Trusts concerned ( Herefordshire & Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( HWHCT ) and Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( GHCT ) ) as to how each others mental health services are run ì otherwise arrangements would have been made for Mr. Harpers mental health to be assessed urgently, as was intended. (5) If staff at HWHCT and GHCT do not understand how to make urgent mental health referrals or requests for urgent mental health assessments to each other, there remains a risk that other deaths may occur in similar circumstances in the future."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifions GP had made a very urgent referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation within BCUHB on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this very urgent referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients. b. During the evidence it was accepted that a above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Boards investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement. An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifions death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner."

The Rt Hon Suella Bravermen MP Secretary of State for the Home Department House of Commons London SW1A 0AA"," During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety considerations. However, the ELFT policy, training, culture and expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight. Clinical staff must be adequately prepared for such an eventuality. That means more than simply a change in policy wording. 2. By the time the HCA rang the duty senior nurse for advice Ms Findlay was out of sight, and so the HCA was instructed to return to the ward. I heard evidence that an email is to be sent out shortly to explain that a new ELFT absent without leave policy will be in place by the end of June 2023. The new policy will confirm that, if it is safe to do so an escort may follow a patient who has absconded, keeping them in line of sight whilst ringing the duty senior nurse for instructions. However, there is no ELFT policy for what those instructions should be or even what they could include. No member of ELFT gave evidence of any organisational thought having gone into how then to progress such a situation, other than the ward calling the police to report a missing person. No member of ELFT giving evidence was able to set out what the staff member following should do. This appears to be a significant omission. 3. Moreover, one of the MPS policy leads in this area gave evidence that in such a situation the police would not necessarily attend, even if called direct by a hospital staff member in the street following a patient about whom they are worried. I spent some time examining the police regarding this point, and I was left with the impression that a clinician calling the police in what the clinician perceived to be an emergency situation might not be assisted by the police. That concerned me. 4. I heard that Right Care, Right Person is an operational model developed by Humberside Police that changes the way the emergency services respond to calls involving concerns about mental health. I understand that it is in the process of being rolled out across the UK as part of ongoing work between police forces, health providers and government. I heard that the MPS has already created a similar model under the resource and demand team. The protocol is called Affinity. It attempts to target preventable demand from the mental health trusts. I was told that ELFT and the MPS work in partnership, so I asked the MPS what is meant to happen if an escort is following a patient who has run away and about whom the escort is worried. I was told that this is primarily a health problem. It was pointed out that doctors, nurses and other hospital staff have the same powers as the police under section 18 of the Mental Health Act. Hospital employees have the legal authority to take a sectioned patient into custody and return them to hospital. However, I heard nothing of an ELFT protocol that would advise staff on the ward to come out to assist an escort who already following a patient. I heard nothing of a trust contingency plan that would allow a ward to function without the doctors and nurses needed to undertake such a task. I heard nothing of any training given to doctors and nurses in how to restrain a patient in the middle of the street and to transport them back to the ward. From the evidence I heard, the police / health trust partnership working allows each agency to regard such a situation as the others responsibility, whilst nobody is on the ground attempting to retrieve a seriously ill patient who is meant to be inside a locked ward for their own safety. Whether this is a matter of policy or practice, the result is the same. If partner agency working is to be effective in caring for this extremely vulnerable cohort of patients, there needs to be crystal clear understanding by all those involved, from the highest policy maker to the most junior member of a team at the sharp end, of how to tackle these difficult situations and exactly who is meant to be doing what. 5. Evidence was given that the police classify a person at high risk as: the risk is immediate and there are substantial grounds for believing immediate risk of self harm. I was told by the MPS that, at the time of reporting to the MPS, trusts should volunteer their own grading of the patients risk. The police said that they will not necessarily following the trust grading, but they regard it as a significant factor and it should form part of the MPS thinking. ELFT witnesses told me that if the police did not ask for the trusts grading then the trust would not offer it. I was told that, until April 2022 the grab pack prepared by ELFT for the MPS in such a situation was printed out and handed to police if & when the police attended the ward. It is now filled out on a portal as part of the reporting procedure. However, it is not clear to me how far the grab pack aligns with local policies, whether all useful information (including the trusts grading of risk) is recorded as a matter of routine, and how far the police and the trust are using the same terminology with the same definitions. It seems that this would benefit from consideration. 6. ELFT staff all told me that, after Ms Findlay had run off, they still graded her as medium rather than high risk. She had had long term suicidal thoughts, had made previous attempts on her life and, prior to being admitted to hospital on 20 May 2020 had purchased sodium nitrate and had planned to take this to kill herself. However, she had appeared to improve in hospital, and had been granted 15 minutes escorted leave twice a day since 1 June without incident. At one point in her evidence it appeared to me that the matron, taking the point that by running away Ms Findlay had acted in a manner that was wholly unexpected by the trust, was of the view that Ms Findlay should then have been re-categorised as high risk. However, following re-examination by counsel for ELFT the matron appeared to retract this and to return to her former position that, even after she had run away Ms Findlay was only of medium risk to herself. It is of course a matter of clinical opinion what risk grading a patient should be given, and no person can see into the future. However, ¬∑ the jury found a failure by ELFT to recognise that, by 11 June 2020, Ms Findlay was at imminent risk of suicide by sodium nitrate; and ¬∑ any investigation following a death like Heather Findlays presents an opportunity for sober and searching reflection. So I am concerned that an element of positional bias may have influenced the thinking of ELFT staff. I am concerned about this particularly because, when giving evidence at inquest, the ELFT serious incident investigation author was adamant that it was only appropriate for the HCA who called the police on 11 June 2020 after Ms Findlay had run away, to tell the police of a risk of self harm not of a risk of suicide. Her rationale for this was that the last time Ms Findlay had articulated a plan to kill herself, was when she was found in hospital with a ligature round her neck on 28 May 2020. This position seems lacking the necessary reflection. I draw your attention to earlier prevention of future deaths reports (PFDs) as follows: ¬∑ Sent to ELFT on 8 June 2023 by Assistant Coroner Buckett following the inquest touching the death of Hilary (Billy) Guedalla, including concern regarding the failure of ELFT to inform the police of the serious suicide risk that the deceased posed to themselves; and the confusion among staff about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing. ¬∑ Sent to ELFT on 25 January 2023 by me following the inquest touching the death of Andrew Largin, including concern about omissions from a serious incident investigation. ¬∑ Sent to ELFT on 20 October 2021 by me following the inquest touching the death of Freeda Glausiusz, including concern about a lack of learning culture at ELFT."

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Evidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that: 1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (úthe unitù) which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide. 2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made. 3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit. 4. The úSign in/Sign outù book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods. 5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user should be permitted to leave the unit. 6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceaseds medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident. 7. Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally. 8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing. 9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceaseds family once the deceased was found to be missing. 10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally. The summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern."

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. I was shocked when I listened to the recording of the call that [REDACTED] made to the crisis line the day before his daughter died. The East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT) serious incident (SI) report observed that the clinician did not elicit clear risks during the conversation; did not listen to [REDACTED] ; talked over him; did not appear empathic; and dismissed his distress about his daughter, even though she was a patient known to services after a first episode of psychosis. In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved, I agreed with all of those observations. [REDACTED] was not taken seriously, he was not treated respectfully and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly desperate about his daughters mental health and, as we now know, he was right to be desperate. He rang the crisis line and he was belittled. The clinician then made no note of the call in the medical records, even retrospectively. I note the many recommendations of the thoughtful SI report, but I remain concerned on three counts. ¬∑ This is not the first time that I have made a PFD report to ELFT about its crisis line. ¬∑ Not only did the clinician in question not make a note of the call in the medical record, he told me in court that, after Freeda Glausiuszs death his manager had told him not to make an appropriately dated retrospective note in the record. He said that he had made a note on a piece of paper, but he did not now have that piece of paper. When I asked the lead SI reviewer if the trust is confident that it has taken all appropriate actions in respect of that clinician, she was not able to give me that assurance. 2. I heard at inquest that the clinician and his manager had listened to the recording of the call within days of the death and had recognised very significant shortcomings. However, the recording was not then volunteered to my coroners officer. I was aware of the existence of the call only because [REDACTED] told my officer about it. ¬∑ I received a copy of the recording of the call (without a transcript) the day before the inquest. ¬∑ I received a statement from the clinician who took the call the day before the inquest. ¬∑ I received statements from other ELFT clinicians in dribs and drabs earlier this month. ¬∑ I received a copy of the SI report the day before the inquest. ¬∑ I never received a copy of the 48 hour hot de-brief. ¬∑ Freeda Glausiusz died five months ago. My officer first requested witness statements and a copy of any internal investigation on 7 June, over four months ago, and asked for the statements to be provided by 20 August. This chronology does not demonstrate an eagerness to promote a learning culture by ELFT. The failure to provide prompt and candid co-operation with my office obstructs the coronial inquiry, an inquiry that includes the function of learning from deaths. And it does not demonstrate respect for the family of the deceased."

There is also an initiative to standardise documentation, for example, at handover, and later MDT (when risks are reviewed), to ensure this is incorporated into RiO, together with an express intention to involve the family in decision-making. It was accepted that risk should be assessed by a nurse prior to granting leave to an informal patient particularly where unescorted leave is being considered for the first time. Although Chriss death occurred in February 2022, it also became clear that the process had not been completed. It was hoped this could be achieved by the end of July this year but the inquest was told there would need to be consideration of the proposals by the different consultants now involved. I was concerned to ensure that the process was completed without undue delay and it is with this in mind that I now write to you."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The concerns arising out of this investigation and inquest relate to the following key areas, a) Safeguarding b) Mental health provision c) Inter-agency communication ì particularly where there is some doubt over who should provide additional support needed by a person. We heard in evidence that in the months after Lucys death, a Safeguarding Adults Board considered the case, but did not consider that a Safeguarding Adults Review (SAR) should be undertaken. Evidence from Wokingham Borough Council was that they were not at that time aware of the number of safeguarding referrals that had been made. A decision was made (some six days before the inquest) that a SAR will now be conducted. The evidence of the Assistant Director of Adult Social Care was that this is likely to be completed within 1-3 months after the inquest. I have set out the issues / concerns that I have for each of the two recipients of this report, below. Reading Borough Council 1) Time scales for review and triage of safeguarding referrals. 2) Requirements to speak to the individual about whom safeguarding concerns have been raised. 3) Training around Section 42 and when a report meets the threshold for neglect or abuse. This training should also consider what options are available if a concern does not meet the threshold for a Section 42 enquiry. 4) Systems for making other involved agencies aware of safeguarding referrals and concerns. 5) In relation to each of the above points, whether RBC should reflect the above changes in formal (written) policy, as well as delivering training. 6) Improving interaction amongst agencies involved, and consideration of the threshold for arranging joint meetings to discuss service users, whether they meet Section 42 thresholds or not. The evidence we heard is that this is now being actively encouraged. Should there be written guidance about this somewhat subjective issue ? 7) Whether they consider that the resourcing of this service is adequate and safe. 8) Systems for auditing, and what will happen if the auditing reveals ongoing issues. Berkshire Health Care 1) How do the changes/proposed changes to systems (including the One Team approach) make a difference? Specifically: a) Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would not be discharged from the crisis team without additional support, as she was on 2nd February? b) Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would be offered some support, whether by the crisis team or otherwise, in the situation that arose on the 15th February? 2) Do they consider that resourcing of these services is adequate and safe?"

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Patients who attend a Hospital Accident and Emergency Department with mental health difficulties are in most hospitals seen by a Mental Health Liaison team (made up of Consultant Psychiatrists and Mental Health nurses) These staff are not employed by the Acute Hospital Trust but are employed by a local Mental Health Trust (in this particular case it was the Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust). As a result of their employment status the Mental Health Liaison team (who have the best knowledge of the patient having been caring for them) cannot invoke the Doctors or Nurses holding powers under Section 5(2) Mental Health Act (Section 5(4) for nurses). If a patient decides to abscond from the Acute Trust Hospital the Mental Health staff cannot detain/hold the patient. They would have to ask a Doctor within the Acute Hospital to do so. This Doctor may not have any knowledge of the patient and would be unlikely to act immediately in a busy A&E. By that time the patient would have been long gone. Due to this technical issue around the employment status of the Mental Health Team, those suffering with a deteriorating mental health in an acute setting are at risk in these circumstances."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. The inquest heard evidence that the backlogs for therapy were such that the waiting list at the time she was assessed as being appropriate for step 4 therapy had a two year wait time. Since that time the waiting period had not decreased and was now between 2 -3 years in both primary and secondary care. This was due to a shortage of trained therapists and demands on the service and was a national issue not specific to the CWP trust. 2. The inquest was told that the trust had since Michelles death recognised that the lack of ownership created through the application of its referral and discharge policy internally carried an unacceptable risk. Significant changes had been made. However it was unclear if nationally the lesson had been shared and that other mental health trusts had taken similar steps. 3. The evidence before the inquest was that there needed to be a clear understanding by all prosecuting authorities of the impact of a prosecution on someone with a complex mental health background such as Michelle. In Michelles case the BTP file reviewer (the nature of the offence Michelle faced meant that it was not a CPS lawyer who made the charging decision) had not correctly applied the public interest test and had not considered the mental health/vulnerability of Michelle Jennings as required to. As a consequence a decision was taken to prosecute her without an assessment of the impact on Michelle and her case was dealt with by the Magistrates Court without them being given the full background in relation to her deteriorating mental health. BTP are as a consequence of Michelles death taking steps to address how their prosecution teams should deal with the public interest test and gather information where mental health is an issue. However there is no clear mechanism for such learning and changes (to reduce the risk to life) in relation to vulnerable people such as Michelle to be implemented within the other 42 Police Forces in England and Wales or within other agencies responsible for prosecuting criminal offences.

UB2 4SD.","Matters of Concern 1. The generic, tick-box style of history recording by CATT which does not paint a full and proper picture of the mental health of the patient, especially compared to the assessments of psychiatric liaison, are such that risk may be unrecorded and under appreciated by CATT and patients thus be put at risk. 2. That the role of CATT to look for alternatives to admission may risk CATT discharging patients who would benefit from admission and risk the repeat of making treatment plans that had recently failed such as in this case. Rather than looking for admission alternatives being a core function, should CATT rather better be focussed on the best treatment plan for the individual patient and thus admission being viewed as a clear option where appropriate rather a last resort, as it often appears to be presented in such cases before the coroner? 3. That the provision of care-coordinators be increased and improved so that patients who require them have ready access at the time of need and are not placed on a waiting list. 4. That patients to be discharged by CATT, as well as patients to be admitted are discussed with the on-call psychiatrist so that plans may be reviewed, and thus the risk of not admitting patients who would benefit from and/ or require admission such as Mr Khala, are less likely to be discharged inappropriately. 5. That where psychiatric teams differ in their assessments such as CATT and psychiatric liaison, as occurred here, patients are not discharged until opinion is sort from the on-call consultant and re-discussion taken place between those with differing views. 6. That expertise covering neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD and ADHD is available as part of MINT."

Hon. Lucy Frazer KC, MP, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport"," During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Preamble During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard about Mr. Ashtons gambling activities, both prior to and, in greater detail, after July 2019. The evidence showed that Mr. Ashton had, at times, used a number of ways to protect himself from the potential of excessive losses from, and excessive deposits into, his online account, in order to gamble. Those methods included self-exclusion, temporary or permanent, from certain products and/or activities and placing limits on the value of his deposits and/or losses, during a specific, pre-determined period of time. During the relevant period examined closely during the investigation and inquest, between July 2019 and the date of Mr. Ashtons death on 22 April 2021, although Mr. Ashton utilised a number of what are known as player protection tools, as outlined above, the operator he was gambling with during the relevant period, Betfair, did not take any measures, save for sending a number of e-mails to Mr. Ashton, to tell him about the existence of a number of protection tools that players could potentially access. During the relevant period, the evidence showed that Mr. Ashton was a problem gambler and, in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, his problem gambling became more acute, intrusive and, on balance, distressing to him. Concerns 1) I remain concerned that the player protection tools, as mentioned above, were and are inadequate to protect a person such as Mr. Ashton, who was a problem gambler with a worsening problem, specifically that such tools do not amount to any or any meaningful interaction with the gambler, or any intervention into the practices of the gambler. 2) I remain concerned that the algorithm devised and operated by Betfair, to assist its staff in, amongst other things, observing and monitoring the gambling patterns and practices of its customers, failed to flag up Mr. Ashton as a problem gambler, despite the increases in his time online (gambling) the value of his deposits and the size of his losses, in part because his gambling practices, even in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, were deemed not to be exceptional, when averaged among gambling customers, generally. 3) I remain concerned that, as was apparent through the evidence of a senior employee witness during the course of the inquest, the operator Betfair appears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice in order to prevent further harming problem gamblers, or those who, as a result of their changing practices and patterns are likely to become problem gamblers."

NHS England. NHS Digital. NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board. Chief Executive, Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Trust. Chief Executive, Birmingham City Council."," During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. There continues to be a chronic lack of resources to treat seriously mentally ill patients in Birmingham and Solihull. In the summer of 2022 Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (BSMHFT) wanted to admit the deceased to an inpatient psychiatric unit, however, no bed was available, and he remained in the community. Shortly before his death, the deceased had been detained by the police under section 136 of the mental health act. There was no available place of safety and he had to be taken to an emergency department. The police, BSMHFT, and hospital Drs agreed the deceased needed to be assessed under the mental health act, however Birmingham City Council could not provide an approved mental health practitioner (AMPH) to attend in a 24-hour period. When the section 136 lapsed the deceased was discharged home after a review by a mental health nurse. At the time of his death the deceased was on BSMHFTs waiting list for a care- coordinator. The lack of care-coordinators, mental health inpatient beds, place of safety, and AMHPs, presents a risk seriously mentally ill people are not receiving necessary treatment. The evidence is that these issues are a consequence of a chronic lack of resources at a local and national level. The Birmingham and Solihull coroners have been repeating identical concerns in Prevention of Future Death Reports for many years. 2. BSMHFT utilizes self-contained specialist teams. The deceased was treated by (a) crisis team/home treatment team, (b) community mental health team, and (b) psychiatric liaison team. The evidence demonstrated communication between the specialist teams was not effective and this caused delays. For example, the psychiatric liaison team nurse that reviewed the deceased updated the community mental health team. However, the GP could not prescribe the deceaseds medication in October 2022 because it had not been approved by the community mental health team consultant via an ESCA and the deceased went without his medication. The deceaseds GP had to contact the community mental health team directly notwithstanding the psychiatric liaison nurses involvement. The deceased cited this delay as making his mental health worse shortly before his death. My concern is communication between the specialist teams is not effective enough. BSMHFTs RCA action plan is to seek assurance from the CCG/ICB that communication between the specialist teams is being strengthened. My concern is that this does not go far enough and there should be consideration of a formal process or policy. 3. Carbamazepine management was proposed in 2012 to manage the deceaseds mental health however this was not picked up by his GP and was only noted by a BSMHFT consultant in August 2022. Therefore, the deceased went 10 years without this medication. BSMHFT could not explain at the inquest why this omission had not been identified sooner. BSMHFTs RCA action plan does not have any action to avoid a repeat occurrence. My concern is this issue indicates a problem with process and systems and further consideration is required to avoid a repeat occurrence. 4. The deceaseds GP raised concerns that different health organisations use different digital systems that do not communicate with each other. Further, GPs often do not get important patient updates from primary care organisations for many days or weeks. (See examples above: the GP did not pick up the carbamazepine prescription, and could not prescribe the medication in October 2022). My concern is communication between different health organisations is not as effective as it could be and important information is being missed, and consequently a material delay in treatment is occurring. 5. The deceaseds GP raised concerns that current resources do not allow GPs to pro- actively check patients are collecting prescribed medication due to excessive patient lists. My concern is that this is a consequence of lack of resources at a national level. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.

Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to when, where and by (or between) whom any formal handover of responsibility as Care Coordinator (CC) for Jo took place as between a number of CCs allocated to Jo over a period of many months from the lead up to and following her discharge as an in-patient back to the community team on December 18th 2020 and through to early May 2021. 2. Consequently , the evidence confirmed, despite her clear vulnerabilities, Jo did not have an allocated Care Coordinator for several weeks up to the beginning of May 2021. The evidence also confirmed that the lack of clarity as to the timing and conduct of CC handovers and the absence of an allocated CC to work with Jo (and by extension, her family) was informed by lack of a formal policy or procedure requiring that a full, detailed, formal record of handover between Care Coordinators is to be placed on EPUT electronic records. 3. Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to who, amongst EPUT clinicians/staff, has the responsibilitv for oversight of patient carefollowing discharge, including responsibility for ensuring adequate and appropriate safety-netting is in place in the event of relapse, where a Care Coordinator is no longer in place/has not been replaced. Please note that this 3rd concern was previously raised by me with ì CEO of EPUT (and in very similar terms) in a PFDR dated 25.02.2022 following the death of Stephanie Moyce. 4.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) A detailed review of the evidence in this case, which included evidence from two Schools ([REDACTED]), as well as from Bradford Childrens Social Services, the TRACKS Education team (at Bradford Council), the SCIL Team and the Councils SEND Team, revealed that no one person or department at Bradford Council had an overview of Councils involvement in relation to Leah (prior to her death). Of greater concern was that that remained so after each of the Council departments involved were notified that Leah had passed away. Every organisation which had contact with the Coroners service in relation to Leahs death, with the exception of Bradford Council, was able to provide the Court with an overview/analysis of their involvement with Leah prior to her death and (where appropriate) the lessons they had learnt as a result their involvement with Leah. The Police and the local Mental Health Trust were examples of two public bodies who had and were able to provide an overview/analysis to the Court in terms of their involvement with Leah and confirm whether there were any lessons to be learned by them. The evidence provided by witnesses from the various Bradford Council teams which were involved with Leah, showed a clear disconnect in the involvement of the various Council departments. That was not caused by those individuals who had provided written statements to the Court or the two who attended to provide oral evidence. Whilst the Inquest hearing did not identify actions/omissions on the part of individuals/teams within the Council which more than minimally, negligibly or trivially contributed to Leahs death, the concern is that Bradford Council appeared not to have a system/process in place which allowed anyone (whether an individual / a team) within the Council to have an overview of deaths where there had been previous Council involvement with the deceased (in this case a child). In the apparent absence of such oversight Bradford Council would not be able to learn lessons from such cases (or even know if there were lessons to be learned). The absence of such a single point of oversight as was apparent in Leahs case, contributes to the risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Pre-amble The inquest heard evidence that Miss Zarins had suffered with depression since 2008. She managed this by taking anti-depressant medication intermittently, she stopped taking her anti-depressants in June/July 2021. Miss Zarins came under the care of Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust (úLPTù) on 22 November 2021, after taking an intentional overdose the day before. Miss Zarins was initially under the care of LPTs Mental Health Liaison team but was transferred to the care of LPTs CRISIS Team when she returned to her home address on 22 November 2021. Miss Zarins expressed a desire to work with the CRISIS team and to recommence anti-depressants as soon as possible in order to improve her mental health. On 23 November 2021 Miss Zarins was discussed at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (úMDTù) meeting at LPT. The discussions at that meeting were fundamentally flawed, as was the plan for Miss Zarins care moving forward that was formed at that meeting and then implemented. The meeting proceeded on the basis that Miss Zarins was on, and had been on, anti-depressant medication at the time of taking the overdose, this was incorrect. The second and final MDT meeting where Miss Zarins was discussed (on 24 November 2021) also proceeded on this same mistaken basis. Despite Miss Zarins verbalising both her desire to get more sleep and her desire to go back onto anti-depressants as soon as possible, neither sleeping tablets nor anti-depressants were prescribed to her by LPT before she died. LPT continued to advise Miss Zarins that she would have to wait until 30 November 2021 to have a medical review. A member of LPT staff who was present at both MDT meetings informed the inquest that he did not have time to read the notes of the patients that were to be discussed at the MDT meetings. The staff member had not read Miss Zarins core assessment documentation (which correctly stated she was not on any anti-depressants) before either MDT meeting. Evidence heard at inquest was that Miss Zarins should have been put back onto anti- depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets on 23 November 2021. LPT undertook a Serious Incident Investigation into the care provided to Miss Zarins before her death. The investigation was wholly inadequate. Issues include, but are not limited to: 1. There was no medical input into the investigation; 2. The investigation failed to explore appropriately the functionality of the MDT meetings; 3. The investigation failed to identify the error in understanding of the Miss Zarins medication position; 4. Due to the fact that the investigation failed to identify the error relating to the understanding of the medication position, the investigation also failed to identify the fact that the treatment plan that was implemented was flawed. The investigation failed to identify the fact that Miss Zarins should have been recommenced on anti- depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets before her death. Notwithstanding the inadequacy of the Serious Incident report the document accepts that, whilst the anti-depressants would not have had an immediate impact on Miss Zarins mood, the thought of having to wait a week for this medication may have added to her sense of hopelessness. This was echoed by witnesses at the inquest. I also accept, on the balance of probabilities, and when considered alongside Miss Zarins clear desire to recommence her anti-depressants in order to get better, that the fact she was told she had to wait a week for a medical review would have added to her sense of hopelessness. Concerns 1) I am concerned about the CRISIS team MDT meetings and their functionality. It is difficult to understand how a meeting attended by around 7 people agreed a treatment plan which was based upon incorrect information relating to the patients medication status. This is particularly difficult to understand when the correct medication status is clearly documented in the patients core assessment paperwork (which was completed by the Liaison Team on 22 November 2021 and sent to the CRISIS Team). An LPT staff member was candid about the fact that he did not have enough time to review patients records before the MDT meetings, this is a grave concern. 2) I remain concerned about both the standard of documentation and lack of documentation relating to the discussion of Miss Zarins at the two MDT meetings. The Trust were only able to provide me with documentation relating to one of the two MDT meetings. That documentation is incorrectly completed and lacks detail. In particular, there is no detail about medication despite there being a specific box within which to document this. This problem of poor and/or missing documentation is not a risk that is limited to the CRISIS Team, it is one that could have ramifications not only across the Trust but across all of the bodies who come together to provide care for patients. 3) I remain gravely concerned about the inadequacies in the Serious Incident Investigation and Reporting processes at Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust. The Serious Incident Investigation failed to identify the errors in the care provided to Miss Zarins making the use of the process somewhat otiose in this case. The failure to properly investigate led to the wholly untenable situation where errors in care were uncovered for the first time at inquest, which took place some 20 months after the date of death (due to witness availability). I am concerned that the lack of robust critical analysis and investigation of the care provided to Miss Zarins before her death has caused a delay to, and led to missed opportunities (for some staff) to learn lessons that are vital to patient safety. My concerns relating to the inadequacy of the Trust Serious Incident Investigations and the risks related to that go far beyond just the care provided by the CRISIS Team. The risks have the ability to prevent learning, therefore negatively impact upon patient safety, across the entire Trust."

In the course of the inquest I heard that British Transport Police had recommended to Network Rail that they consider installing úanti trespass treads and gates to the north end of Platforms on Askam station if operationally possibleù. By a letter to the Court dated 5th June 2023 Network Rail indicated that they had decided not to take this step. They explained that Askam station is rural, that limited resources dictate which works are prioritised and that there is no history of trespass. In the course of the inquest the court heard that the line in this location is more accessible that might usually be expected, including by stiles in nearby fences associated with a nearby golf club. In the circumstances I am concerned that the line may be readily accessible to individuals who wish to harm themselves."

The Inquest identified multiple failings in the care provided to Allison. The failings occurred within a children and adolescent mental health service which was significantly under resourced. The Inquest heard evidence that the under resourcing of CAMHS services is not confined to this local Trust but is a matter of National concern. The under resourcing of CAMHS services contributed to delays in Allison being assessed by the mental health team. The delay between triage to assessment was 9 months. The Inquest heard evidence that this delay is not unusual within CAMHS teams across the country. There was very little evidence of any consultant psychiatrist leadership within the CAMHS team. The Inquest heard of the difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified psychiatrists to CAMHS teams. The Inquest heard that funding for CAMHS teams within the allocation of funding for general mental health is poor. The Inquest heard that the number of children presenting to CAMHS teams is increasing significantly. The number of referrals of children to the local CAMHS team in the early 2010s was between 10 ì 12 per week. The current number of referrals is in the region of 140 patients per week.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. I received evidence, in particular from the investigating officer (OIC), who dealt with the investigation into the allegation against Mr Leger, and from an investigator from the Metropolitan Polices Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS), who conducted an investigation on behalf of the IOPC into the way in which the criminal investigation was undertaken, in particular the consideration of Mr Legers welfare and support offered to him. I heard evidence: ¬∑ That when a person who has been RUId is charged, standard practice (in accordance with current Metropolitan Police policies and procedures) is for that charge to be communicated to them via a PCR with no advance warning. ¬∑ That this is the case regardless of the offence, or seriousness of the offence, with which they are being charged. ¬∑ That in exceptional circumstances, where an individual is considered to be in a high-risk category, arrangements can be made for the PCR to be delivered in person and/or for a third party to be present to provide support. ¬∑ That it is recognised that certain types of allegation, such as a sexual allegation (as was the case here), may carry a higher risk. This, of itself, does not place an individual into a high-risk category for the purposes of delivering the news that they are to be charged (by way of a PCR). ¬∑ That whether an individual is, exceptionally, considered to be in a high-risk category (such as to cause a PCR to be delivered in person) is reliant on information about their mental health coming to the attention of the OIC. There is no formal requirement for the OIC proactively to seek this information. ¬∑ That there is no formal process for assessing an individuals mental health and/or risk of suicide or self-harm at the time of delivery of a PCR. It is important to note the following: ¬∑ At the point of charge, nothing has been proven against the individual concerned. They face an allegation, and are innocent if and until proven guilty to the criminal standard. ¬∑ Many people are RUId. As such, PCR is now routinely used to bring most criminal charges. ¬∑ Individuals who have been RUId can remain with this status for long periods of time (months or years) before a decision is made whether or not to charge them. ¬∑ Whilst there are formal procedures to assess an individuals mental health and risk of self-harm or suicide when they attend a police station for interview, once they have left the police station there are no such formal procedures (as above), notwithstanding the potential for a substantial period to elapse between the time they last attended a police station and the time that they are charged. ¬∑ Being charged with any criminal offence, especially one which carries the potential for a custodial sentence, can, self-evidently, have a significant deleterious effect on an individuals mental health. It appears to me that, in the absence of a formal mechanism to assess, at the time of being charged, an individuals mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm, there is an obvious risk of individuals in the future taking their own lives as a result of being charged by way of a PCR (potentially following a lengthy period of having been RUId and potentially months or years since there was last any consideration by the police of their mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm). In Mr Legers case, the relevant policies and procedures were those of the Metropolitan Police. However, these issues clearly arise at a wider (national) level and, as head of the College of Policing, you have overall responsibility for policies/guidance disseminated at a national level."

The Health Boards Transfer of Care document at the time the transfer occurred did not include any detail or process as to how the transfer should occur. The amended policy has still not been finalised and there remains a concern that deaths will continue to occur if the process is not finalised and shared widely within the Health Board to staff. c. Patient notes for mental health are still not electronic; they are paper based. I have issued several Prevention of Future Death Reports specifically relating to this. There has been considerable delay in actioning this and yet there is still not anticipated timescale for this to occur. As such, deaths will continue to occur or may occur into the future with the risk that notes are paper based only. The risk relates to only one department or individual having access to them at once when there is wider support for the patient."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) HMP Aylesbury transitioned from a High Security Young Offenders Institution (a role it had undertaken for many years) into a Category C Training Prison after the time in which Haik Nikolyan had been an inmate. This has led to a quite different cohort of prisoners with different and additional issues to be addressed in their management and healthcare needs. Staffing changes have also occurred over the period, although the physical prison infrastructure is largely the same with some wing refurbishments being undertaken from time to time. Healthcare provision is also being undertaken by different providers today. Following the conclusion in March this year of an Inquest into the death of another young prisoner, Anthony McNally, at Aylesbury (which occurred in January 2021), a letter was written by me to the Governor in which I noted, inter alia, that the evolution to Category C status required time and resources and was not without significant challenges going forward. I was then (as now) interested to hear that appropriate resources continued to be sought and deployed by the prison to continue the work, from prison and healthcare perspectives, adapting to the Category C status, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of prisoners, staff and those with cause to visit the prison going forward. Some three months further on, my concerns are heightened to the extent that a death may result in a variety of circumstances through the continuing significant issues HMP Aylesbury is encountering in recruitment and retention of experienced prison staff, particularly Grade 3 officers. Although initial steps are being taken towards implementation of a new neurodiversity plan, including the management of prisoners with autistic traits (pertinent to the circumstances of the death of Haik Nikolyan in 2019) and some recruitment has just taken place, without appropriate resources specifically in this area and within the broader staff cohort, there will be difficulties in maintaining this important work. The evidence heard at this Inquest in July 2023 indicates that general staffing levels are likely to impact upon the operation of the daily regime, training and reaction to individual incidents, against a background of increasing levels of violence and access to illicit substances, resulting from the changing cohort of longer-term and older prisoners within this Category C institution. The indication in evidence was that addressing these issues and continuing to address these issues is a matter for His Majestys Prisons and Probation Service, working with HMP Aylesbury."

A number of these have been addressed and do not require a PFD report. I have also considered a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, úThe experience of immigration detainees in prisons,ù dated September 2022. Some of the key concerns in that report mirror concerns I came to independently having heard the evidence in this Inquest. Published responses to the report suggest some concerns are being addressed, albeit it is not clear if they have been resolved. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Although the specific issues below were not left to the jury as úcausative mattersù in this Inquest, I am concerned about the potential impact of these issues in other cases. Timing of IS91 notification. 2. The timing of the notification to Mr Santos by the SSHD that he was not to be released at the end of his custodial sentence but was to be held on immigration detention pending a decision on deportation. The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (úFNOsù) by notification at this stage. Signposting legal advice about immigration matters 3. Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020. 4. I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted. 5. In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 2021. In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion. Communication between agencies 6. Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs. 7. I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of úprison offender managersù who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs. Delays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information. 8. I am concerned at the potential impact of delays/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report. 9. I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (úIPTsù). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information. The SSHD Internal report 10. The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed. 11. The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction. 12. This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department. Although I am told that these are now being addressed, I am concerned that important learning points (which could prevent future deaths) were not disseminated and actioned as they should have been. Opening cell doors at night 13. In evidence there was a continued misunderstanding that the policy did not apply to Operational Support Grade (OSG) officers and it was understood that they should never open cell doors at night. This was despite the PPO report dated December 2021 (at paragraph 73) requesting this be addresses 14. The prison stated in PFD evidence that all staff will be instructed as to the policy in terms of opening cell doors at night (which requires a dynamic risk assessment). 15. I remain concerned that this appears to be a longstanding belief held by experienced officers."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. The use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners (CNPs) in Police custody instead of doctors. The 2003 Home Office circular appeared to envisage nurses working alongside doctors, when this is not how they are deployed. CNPs are also seeing high risk and complex patients without adequate training in mental health. The deployment in Police custody of CNPs places detained persons at risk of death in the future. The 2003 Home Office circular also does not recognise the risk of suicide and self-harm as being a core competency. 2. The training of agency staff in the ACCT process and recognising the appropriate threshold to open an ACCT. The training of agency staff in ACCT does not appear to be part of the commissioning process by NHS England and individual providers do not appear to provide training to agency staff in the ACCT process. This places residents in prison at risk of death, given the high level of usage of agency healthcare staff in prison."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1) It was evident that the lack of consistency in staff dealing with Mr Donoghues care was a factor in his ability to engage and be honest with those having oversight of him at a very fragile time in his treatment. (2) Evidence was heard that the HBTT system is a nationwide treatment as an alternative to hospital admission and although peoples care in HBTT had improved, a real continuity of staff could only occur with a substantive change which would include additional funding, recruitment of appropriate staff and an ability to retain staff. I was informed that if these issues were addressed it would allow more capacity to manage consistency alongside the other demands of the service. (3) It is worthy of note that this is the 2nd inquest heard within 3 weeks in this jurisdiction whereby inconsistency of care staff has been cited as an issue in a suicide. The other inquest was the death of a 20 year old woman. (4) Mental Health is a rising problem and it is my understanding that 115 people die by suicide every week. Acknowledgement of the important work undertaken by HBTT and the need to give the very best support to those who have taken the, often difficult, step of seeking help with their care is a matter that requires imminent attention."

On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October. (2) The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again. (3) If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarahs death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive. (4) I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of úserious incidentù investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary; and (ii) compromise the quality of such investigations and hence their value in preventing avoidable deaths. (5) I am concerned that these dangers persist, despite the Trusts response to previous PFD reports and their assurances that remedial action was being taken to eradicate the delays, and as a result it is my statutory duty to make this further report."

During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. There is no regulation of counsellors in England and Wales and this could lead to future deaths. ii. [REDACTED] is a private counsellor with 30 years experience who provided support to Marnie prior to her death. She confirmed that counselling is not a regulated professional and there are courses available at a cost of ¬£29 for a 6 week course, after which a person can receive a diploma and call themselves a counsellor. There is no requirement for them to do further training or continual professional development. There are no rules or regulations about how counsellors should operate, for example how they keep and share records. iii. Information shared by an individual to a counsellor may disclose a risk of self harm or suicide, or harm to another and there is no requirement for a counsellor to report that information to any third party. iv. [REDACTED] gave evidence that the lack of regulation and licensing of counsellors could lead to a lot of damage being done to individuals seeking help and that this could present a risk to life as there is no regulation around informing medical professionals or others who can provided further support and care to the individual. v. Evidence was also given by [REDACTED] , one of the GPs who provided care to Marnie, that receipt of records from others such as counsellors, especially at the end of the counselling, would assist her in providing care to patients. 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. There is a risk of future deaths occurring due to the lack of regulation of the counselling profession."

The inquest heard evidence of the distress caused to Holly and the impact on her health by the long waits to be seen by gastroenterologists and gynaecologists within the NHS. The evidence heard was that post- Covid, the waiting times to be seen in both specialities unless the referral was on the two-week cancer wait had grown significantly across England. As an illustration the inquest was told that pre-Covid, the average wait for a routine gynaecology referral was 18 weeks. Now in England the wait was often in excess of 12 months. Even an urgent referral would often involve a wait of over 40 weeks. This was leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment even in those with significant/severe health conditions."

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Current DWP procedures may not be practical for those with mental health illness and can exacerbate symptoms. I heard evidence that: 1. The number of and length of DWP forms required to be completed can be overwhelming for someone with a mental health illness. This is perpetuated if the applicant cannot get help to complete the paperwork. 2. There are long telephone queues to speak to a DWP advisor. 3.

https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/elizabeth-watson-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2023-0439,10/11/2023,"Human Resources, [REDACTED]"," During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1) During evidence the matter of monitoring people who attend the bridge in mental health distress was raised. There is a minimum of 2 staff in the control room and 3 staff covering útraffic dutiesù on the ground. The security staff at the bridge deal with a variety of security issues however this report only seeks to address their role in relation to those suffering from mental health distress. The staff are expected to identify and monitor any person of concern entering the walkways of the bridge. This involves looking at their actions, mannerisms, behaviour and body language. Staff are expected to identify those who may require assistance and contact staffing colleagues to approach them. It appeared there was no structured training policy in place to ensure that staff are given appropriate training to deal with identifying vulnerable people. On joining, staff have an 8 weeks mentoring course, whereby an experienced colleague shows them the role and advises on what to look for. Staff may also undertake an on line suicide prevention course and mental health first aid at work as well as safety harness/working at height training. However there appeared to be no structure to any of the training for this vital role and of more concern there was no input from a trained medical professional with significant knowledge of working with those suffering from mental health crisis. Nor was there any current input with regard to how to talk and negotiate with people in crisis. I was informed that there were many very competent staff who had good intuition, but I have concerns that without appropriate and structured input from a health care professional, any experience on the job is based on unstable foundations. It was evident that the role is vitally important in identifying those at risk and seeking the appropriate help. Without receiving knowledge from someone trained in mental health, having a substantive input on negotiation and how to interact with those in crisis then the difficult job of assessing people and reacting appropriately with them becomes very difficult. (2) While the úRight Care/Right Personù process appears to ensure that the correct emergency service should respond if called, delays in response means often staff are left dealing with a vulnerable person for many hours due to unavailability of emergency services or mental health support. (3) I am aware that there is a [REDACTED] Suicide Prevention Meeting where a multi-agency approach can be taken to address the reduction of suicide [REDACTED]. I consider that this may be the correct forum to recognise the unique role the staff play and implement a structured training plan with all agencies input for any person beginning work in that role. (4) I was informed in evidence that a vulnerable person is escorted off the bridge everyday ì this shows the extent of the problem and the staff to be provided with the very best training available. I echo the views of Lizzies family when talking about the role that the Security Staff have úthere is so much responsibility on someones head, for them to decide whether someone is likely to jump or notù. I feel that these people should be given a specific set training plan to help them do what is a vital and important role."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Initial referral ì there seems to be a gap at the initial referral and admission stage in obtaining information about and recording previous methods of self-harm and suicide. There also appears to be a gap in the seeking and recording of relevant information from an individuals family at the point of referral and admission. An individuals family is often able to provide detailed and useful information about events that may not have been previously reported and/or be able to bridge the gap in communications between various health agencies involved in someones care. Access to notes ì the other concerning issue is the difficulty prevalent within the private sector in the accessing of NHS notes. It appears to be the position across the private sector that access to an individuals notes is not provided as standard. This means that there may be a significant gap in the information available when someone is admitted to a premises run by a private healthcare provider, even within an NHS allocated bed. This gap in information can have an impact on an individuals risk assessment and their subsequent care plan."

[REDACTED] Chief Executive Depaul UK Sherborne House 4 Decima Street London SE1 4QQ," During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. On 28 March 2023, Igor refused to get out of the shower [REDACTED]. Hostel staff took various actions, including calling the crisis team. The crisis team decided that Igor did not need daily visits, but told staff to call back if there was any change or further concern. 1. On 14 April 2023, staff found Igor outside, drowsy and incoherent, cold and wet, but did not re-contact the crisis team. 2. Igor was a vulnerable young man, recently homeless, but the last time that any member of staff had a meaningful conversation with him was on 20 April 2023, ten days before he died. 3. The Depaul executive director of services recognised at inquest that there should have been more staff conversation with Igor throughout his time at the London Youth Hub. 4. She also acknowledged that greater attempts should have been made by staff to engage with partner agencies regarding Igors care and welfare. 5. Igor was only 18 years old and his father did visit him, but the hostel did not have any contact details for his family. I heard evidence at inquest that Depaul conducted an internal investigation into Igors death. The fact of the report was not disclosed to my office in advance of the inquest as it should have been, and I did not see it until it was mentioned in evidence at the inquest. However, I have read the report since. It went into some detail and identified that, when Igor was found at 6.25pm, no staff member had undertaken a welfare check of him since half past midnight, whereas there should have been at least one per shift. I was told at inquest that staff were disciplined about this after Igors death. At the time of Igors death, there was no national policy on when to increase welfare checks. I was told that there is now national guidance. The Depaul investigation also identified that staff at the London Youth Hub had not attended self harm and suicide awareness training. I heard that training has now increased and is mandatory. The report described the culture at the London Youth Hub as chaotic."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) ACCT documents In evidence at the inquest ACCT assessors and case managers accepted that they had not complied with various mandatory actions required under PSI 64/2011: Managing Prisoner Safety in Custody. They were not able to identify in evidence the risk factors it was mandatory to consider for persons at risk of suicide or self-harm. They had not recorded triggers in the relevant section of the ACCT nor recorded all risk factors in the Caremap section. One ACCT case manager stated that they did not know whether it was necessary to record a trigger if action had been taken to mitigate it. They also stated they categorised risk based on remaining risk after action had been taken despite having not recorded the trigger. This leads me to have 2 concerns: The first regards the provision and quality of ACCT training and refresher training given this evidence was given some 2 years after the death of Mr Huntley and well after the disruptions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. I also heard evidence that despite an ACCT being a whole prison document (which can and should be opened by any member of staff) training was not mandatory for non-security staff. In 2019 there was no joint training for prison and heathcare staff on the use of ACCT documents. I am informed by CNWL that under ACCT v6 (which has been in force since July 2021) joint training is provided for and this is reassuring. However I understand that the frequency of this training is determined in relation to operational capacity at individual establishment level. This is of concern given the evidence from witnesses at this inquest some 20 months after this version came into force. The second relates to the quality and effectiveness of ACCT audits. We heard evidence that ACCT documents are reviewed annually. The case manager mentioned above advised that he had not received any adverse feedback about the quality of his ACCT documents and no issues with them had been identified. Given the inadequate nature of the ACCT document opened on Mr Huntley and apparent lack of understanding about completing the documents the quality of the audits is brought into question. Information sharing. In evidence it was clear that the ACCT document was the only written document used for sharing information between the healthcare staff employed by the NHS trust and the prison security staff. Healthcare staff record and share their information within SystemOne which the prison security staff do not have access to. Prison security staff record information within NOMIS which healthcare staff do not have access to. Evidence from witnesses revealed that these information systems are not necessarily fully reviewed for relevant information prior to attending ACCT meetings. In addition a decision relating to Mr Huntleys care (i.e. the move to a different cell) was taken by healthcare staff at their own meeting when they did not have the benefit of information available to prison staff. [REDACTED] of HMP Winchester informed me that a Safety Intervention Meeting was now carried out weekly, chaired by a Senior Governor and attended by representatives of the prison, physical and mental health care providers and the probation service. This meeting covers each person subject to an ACCT and any relevant information is share via the ACCT case manager, NOMIS and the multi disciplinary team. [REDACTED] could not assist me with whether this was a HMP Winchester initiative or had a wide application across the prison estate. My concern is therefore that the current procedures and policies for sharing information are incomplete or not fully complied with. This renders the information on which separate teams make decisions about a prisoner incomplete and increases the risk that important factors are not considered. Cells At HMP Winchester within the area, considered and referred to by most healthcare and prison staff, as the mental health cells there are 2 cells which are not equipped in a way to reduce the amount of available ligature points. It was clear from the evidence of the healthcare staff at the MDT meeting on the 28/05/2020 that they did not consider the contents of the cell when deciding to move Mr Huntley to the mental health cells simply due to the fact he was on an ACCT. I heard evidence that the policy of CNWL has now changed and that a cell move risk assessment must now be carried out and that there is now a revised ligature audit process. HMP Winchester informed me that there is now an annual ligature audit carried out in conjunction with the new healthcare provider at that establishment. In addition I was informed that all telephone points in the mental health cells at HMP Winchester have now been removed and placed outside the cells. These are welcome developments. However at inquest those representing the HMPPS could not inform me whether all telephone points within cells designed for use by those at risk of self harm across the prison estate had been removed. Nor was any evidence available as to what consideration had been given to reducing the risk of the telephone points by design of the points themselves or the manner of their installation. Those representing were invited to provide this information after the hearing but have not done so. I am concerned that telephone points which provide a ligature point may remain within cells which prison and health care staff consider to be suitable for use by those at risk of self harm. The final area of concern is the lack of certified Safer Cells at HMP Winchester. The inquest heard evidence that these had either never existed at HMP Winchester or had not done so for many years. The evidence from prison governors was that, generally speaking within the prison estate, they were not used or proved too hard to maintain to the certified standard. However certified Safer Cells are still referred to in PSI 64/2011 as a means of managing risk from ligatures. It was heard in evidence that HMP Winchester experience high levels of self-harm and suicide and yet it did not appear that consideration had been given recently to introducing these. Those representing the HMPSS at the were invited to provide information about the status and use of safer certified cells across the prison estate. No such information has been forthcoming."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. Despite recognising Mr Malone needed to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital in June 2023 but there was no bed capacity, BSMHFT RCA report identified no remedial action. 2. The Patient Safety Manager [REDACTED] gave evidence that the lack of psychiatric bed capacity remains an ongoing problem and has not been resolved, and there is a genuine risk of the same problem with another patient in the future. 3. [REDACTED] added there was an exceptional process, which required a considered decision at a high level, to make a bed available through identifying someone currently occupying a bed space to be discharged. In my view, this process is unsatisfactory as it creates a different set of risks around the patient being discharged, and amplifies the chronic shortage of beds. 4. There was reference to two preceding Regulation 28 Reports to Prevent Future Deaths (both available publicly on the judiciary website) that focussed on the chronic lack of mental health resources in Birmingham and Solihull. In relation to the specific issue of a lack of psychiatric bed capacity, in the case of Peter Fleming (no bed was available in August 2022) BSMHFTs response (September 2023) referred to their response in the earlier case of Leroy Hamilton (no bed was available in December 2021). This response (April 2023) stated more resources had been obtained and a collaborative plan had been implemented with NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board. The issue of adequately funding psychiatric beds is a local and national issue. Locally, BSMHFT require their commissioners to provide the necessary funding. My principal concern is that the above dates indicate available psychiatric bed capacity in Birmingham and Solihull remains inadequate. Whilst some action may have been taken it is insufficient to resolve the problem. It follows there is a genuine risk of future deaths directly connected to a shortage of psychiatric bed spaces in Birmingham and Solihull unless further action is taken."

There was no direct contact between the mental health team and the Deceased (either by telephone or in person) before the decision to reject the referral was made 4. The Consultant Psychiatrist present at the MDT meeting has no recollection of discussing the referral and whilst the evidence was that a letter to the GP practice explaining the reason for rejecting the referral was generated there is no record of this letter on the Trusts electronic systems or having been received by the GP practice 5. The evidence was that there is no member of staff allocated to deal with referrals when the SPoE Nurse is absent from work which means that during their absence, urgent referrals are not being reviewed. 6. There is currently no Standard Operating Procedure on how referrals into the SPoE Older Adults should be managed 7.

The e-learning training module was uploaded to BCUHB system the day prior to the Inquest. It is strongly suspected that this was due to the impending Inquest. 2. The Health Board has not investigated the incident at all. A Medical Examiner Report was prepared following the death in November 2021 highlighting the ingestion of gluten in a coeliac patient. I have raised and continue to raise a number of concerns around the inadequacy of governance and poor investigation processes. 3. There were other incidences of gluten ingestion at Ysbyty Maelor and Deeside Community Hospital.

Zee informed BEH that he had not taken his olanzapine and fluoxetine for two weeks. His GP, who was prescribing that medication, was not informed. I am concerned that GPs are not updated, particularly where patients have expressed suicidal ideation, and may not be aware that people are not taking medication and/or that there may be a risk of stockpiling."

HEREFORD AND WORCESTERSHIRE ICB,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. On 13/07/22 Dr Ellson's GP needed to arrange an urgent mental health review as Dr Ellson had presented with suicidal ideation. The GP had significant difficulties trying to contact the Mental health team with messages giving incorrect numbers. My concern is that the system for GPs to contact mental health teams for urgent reviews is not clear nor safe. 2. Once contact had been made and a request was made for Dr Ellson to be assessed by the mental health team, the system in place is for the patient to call the mental health practitioner. My concern is that the patient is likely to be in crisis, which is why a referral is being made, and the burden should not be put on them to make the call. 3. The GP caring for Dr Ellson on 13/07/22 was unaware that she could make a request for a psychiatric review of the patient. The inquest heard how this was not well known by local GPs. My concern is that GPs should be fully aware how to request an urgent psychiatric review for patients."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Inadequate Police training on Mental Health During the course of the Inquest officers involved in dealing with Jade (and in particular around the exercise of their Section 136 powers on 21/5/20) acknowledged that they had received very little mental health training. Some officers could not recall any additional training provided since their initial training when they first joined the force. The officers admitted that although they were aware of the Sussex Police mental health guide they had not read it in full. The expert police witness, , told the Inquest that in his view the online training provision that we were told was being rolled out in Sussex was not sufficient. None of the officers involved in this case had yet undertaken this online training. It was his opinion that officers should be provided with the nationally recognised two day training course written by the College of Policing, The course is available for all Police forces to be rolled out locally. This training had not been adopted by Sussex Police. There was also confusion amongst Officers (and a lack of clear understanding) around the provision and use of service the Haven at Millview could provide. 2. REBOOT - Lack of provision to for older age group There was clear evidence that Jade was vulnerable and had become involved in violence and crime in 2019 (the year before his death). It was believed by some that Jade exploited by gangs running county line drug operations. A need for an early intervention was identified by his social worker and a referral to Reboot was made. The Inquest was told that at the time REBOOT was prioritising 12 ì 14 years children and as Jade was nearing 18 they were unable to work with him. This was a missed opportunity for Jade to be involved in a form of early intervention before his life started unravelling and he became more heavily entrenched in the world of crime. ancarmed for her son aa tis waa out of character for him and he had previously Been saute The Police treated Jade as a missing person and tried to lacate lade.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 23rd December 2019 an investigation was commenced into the death of Lewis Steven Johnson, aged 34. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 2nd December 2022. The conclusion of the Inquest was a Narrative Conclusion that Mr Johnson died due to 1(a) Hypoxic-ischaemia Encephalopathy 1(b) Hanging after being found suspended by a neck ligature at approximately 04:45 hours on 12th December 2019 at HMP Wealstun. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Lewis Steven Johnson was held at HMP Wealstun from May 2019 until his death 7 months later. He had been seen frequently by healthcare staff, a keyworker, other prison officers and had been subject to an ACCT for a brief period in October 2019. When found with a neck ligature around 04:45 on 12th December in an unresponsive condition, he was cut down, but the various prison officers present then left him in the cell in a seated position without considering CPR, using a defibrillator or considering whether to place him in the recovery position. Approximately five minutes later another prison officer mentioned CPR. Prison officers then returned to his cell and conducted CPR until paramedics arrived. The paramedics succeeded in restoring Mr Johnson's circulation. He was taken to hospital but following a further cardiac arrest, was pronounced dead at 10:56 on 12th December 2019 at Leeds General Infirmary.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. Although it remains my duty to report this matter to you (since the circumstances of concern continue to exist), I note the steps that Durham County Council has taken, and proposes to take, to address these concerns (see below and in your attached letter dated 30th November 2022). The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì All concerns relate to the bridge , which carries a road and two footpaths up to around 30m (100ft) above the reiver Weir (1) the bridgeôs parapet and railing is accessible to pedestrians on the bridge; (3) there is absence of monitored CCTV and lighting or other means of detecting those at immediate risk; and 2 (4) there is a risk of death to persons falling AND to those near the foot of the bridge at any time when persons fall. The body of a further person was found at the foot of the bridge on 3rd December 2022 in circumstances which may be consistent with his having fallen from the top of the bridge. Thank you for your letter dated 30th November 2022 (a copy of which is attached hereto and part of the contents of which were read at inquest); in it you have informed me about various measures which have been implemented and more which are due to be implemented to address these matters and to reduce the risk of future deaths."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the 2 Information Classification: CONTROLLED circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì i. The funding of the force is insufficient to allow it to meet the increase in demand that occurs every summer when tourists come to Devon & Cornwall. I have written separately to the Home Secretary in this regard and a copy of my letter is enclosed for your information. No response is required from you. ii. a) Staffing levels in the CMCUs (both call handlers and Resource Deployment Officers) in Plymouth and Exeter are insufficient for the workloads experienced. b) There are an inadequate number of uniformed Officers available to respond in a timely fashion to the demand seen over the summer months. Let me acknowledge that I recognise these two issues are intertwined. The amount of budget the force receives will dictate what it can afford in terms of police staff and police officers. As Chief Inspector accepted during the course of this inquest, the police did the best they could with what they had; they simply did not have enough. My concern in relation to the CMCUs is that this problem has existed ì on the evidence I heard at inquest ì for a decade or so, and it is unresolved today. Indeed, I am bound to note the recent decision of HMICFRS to move the force into an enhanced level of monitoring with one of the stipulated grounds being: the force does not answer, or respond to, emergency or non-emergency calls within adequate timeframes, and too many calls are abandoned¶ô The jury heard from Chief Supt and ACC Leaper at inquest. They were told that staffing levels for both call handlers and RDOs were still not at the designô brief advised by BT but that recruitment processes were in hand which, it was hoped, would achieve this. They were told that three separate pieces of software were to be introduced in the New Year which, once fully operational, ought to permit greater efficiencies and speedier call management. In writing to you, I wanted to bring these matters to your attention so that you can ensure the intended improvements are realised. I understand once you start in your new role you will require a little time to bring yourself up to speed with what will inevitably be a raft of pressing issues, that budgets for 2022/3 are yet to be finalised and, finally, that the recruitment drive and IT upgrades still need to be completed.

I heard evidence students have a higher incidence of mental health difficulties, self-harm and suicide exacerbated by multifactorial issues such as being effectively itinerant with work and other social pressures. 2. Sarah was known to have significant mental health difficulties exacerbated by a recent bereavement and other personal difficulties. On 19th November 2019 after Sarah hung up on the administrator and was knowingly extremely distressed, CWB staff did not take steps to reassure themselves that Sarah was safe from self-harm. 3. The organisation and systems at the CWB were insufficiently robust to appropriately manage, treat and safeguard students known to have mental health problems and be at high risk to themselves on a background of a lack of national guidance of what are the basic requirements for universities to provide such services. 4. National guidance issued in September 2018 to reduce the incidence of suicide in the student population had not been implemented by CWB at the time of Sarahôs death. 5. There was no internal (by CWB) or external regulatory (by US) oversight as to the service provision at CWB before Sarahôs death or indeed after her death. 6. There was little communication or learning between and a lack of involvement sought or offered by local NHS mental health services to ensure the service provided by CWB was within an acceptable standard. 7.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard from a Detective Inspector with North Yorkshire Police who is a Firearms Licensing Manager. The evidence was that, unlike standard police prosecutions, prosecutions of individuals by other authorities do not involve automatic checks of the Police National Computer which would flag whether that individual is licensed to possess a firearm. The appearance of such an alert allows the firearms licensing authority to assess the individualôs continuing suitability to possess a firearm in the context of the prosecution and its possible outcomes. In this instance, the deceased was being prosecuted for tax fraud by HMRC and was due to make a court appearance on the day of his death. He left a note of intent, indicating that the prosecution and its likely outcome were central to his decision to end his life.

The large number of people seeing Daniel did not make deep professional relationships with him which would allow his needs and risks to be addressed in a person centred and properly risk sensitive way. The relationships with Daniel were superficial and this infected the risk assessment process. The large number of mental health professionals in contact with Daniel inhibited him establishing deep relationships of trust. 5.2 The risk assessments themselves were therefore superficial, often relying uncritically on self-reporting without meaningfully engaging in suicide risk prevention. The initial risk assessment on first contact on 16.07.21 was flawed in that, despite the presenting context being an attempt at suicide by hanging, the risk assessment was low risk of suicideô. 5.3 Daniel was a serving soldier and there was a failure to meaningfully communicate and engage with his Regiment and the medical staff attached to it. 5.4 Communication with the family was superficial and the evidence was that their perception was that they couldnôt fully share issues and concerns because of perceived barriers in information sharing. This may not have been the teamôs intention, but it was the reality felt by the family. This inhibited their engagement with the team in Danielôs best interests. The evidence of was that engagement with the family was important because they were the people who knew Daniel best and who would be the first to identify any risks or concerns. 5.5 There was evidence that staff in the team struggled with decision making around information sharing. For example, on 15.09.21, the day before he died, Danielôs girlfriend called to share concerns about his wellbeing. The person taking the call indicated that Danielôs lack of knowledge of her referral placed the team in difficulty in sharing the information. In the event, a practitioner saw Daniel for a visit only a few minutes later and correctly identified his need for an urgent psychiatric review. Notwithstanding this, I considered that this was evidence of a failure to understand the basics of risk-based information sharing. 5.6 In summary, therefore, I considered that there was evidence that a failure to address these issues could create a risk of further deaths:  Superficiality of risk assessments  Lack of a key worker approach  Lack of communication with the armed forces, army in this case  Superficiality of communication with the family  Anxiety about appropriate risk sharing"

The University is invited to review the provision of training for academic staff upon information sharing [see below], mental health awareness and suicide prevention. 2) Responding proactively The evidence indicated that nobody from the university attempted to speak to or visit Harry despite numerous concerns being raised regarding his wellbeing. There was a total absence of personal engagement. The court heard that research has consistently shown that most students and staff who experience poor mental health do not access formal support. The university response was entirely by email and can be characterized as reactive. The evidence indicated a marked reluctance to respond flexibly and proactively to concerns. The university is invited to review their policy as regards their response to welfare concerns and whether the current approach is sufficiently flexible and proactive. Specifically, whether there is an over-reliance on email responses and students themselves completing online application forms to access support. 3) Sharing information The university policy allows sharing of information with consent in circumstances involving a concern for wellbeing, and without consent in exceptional circumstances. This necessarily would have involved a conversation with Harry and failing that a consideration whether exceptional circumstances applied for sharing information with his parents. The evidence revealed a lack of staff awareness regarding university policy on information sharing. There was evidence of a misunderstanding of policy which specifically allowed the sharing of information in cases of concern, subject to discussion with Harry, and then in exceptional circumstances Information Classification: PUBLIC without his consent. Witnesses referred to a blanket ban on sharing or alternatively to sharing only if they perceived imminent risk to life. The evidence indicated that there was insufficient consideration given to notifying Harryôs parents of the extent of his exam failure, in order to fully mobilize Harryôs support network. There was no evidence of the Think Familyô approach adopted by the university following previous suicides. The University is invited to review the thresholds for sharing information and staff awareness of those thresholds, and the implementation and understanding across academic and welfare staff of the Think Family approach. 4) Pastoral support The evidence indicated that if Harryôs pastoral tutor had known Harryôs mobile number, he may have called him. The court heard that there was no policy for pastoral tutors exchanging mobile numbers with students. The university is invited to review whether pastoral tutors should offer to exchange mobile numbers with their students, and to consider whether pastoral tutors should have a work mobile to facilitate a proactive approach in the event that there are concerns for wellbeing. 5) Welfare services case management system The court heard evidence that systems failures led to safeguarding alerts not being followed up and the case marked closed. The university is invited to review whether the welfare case management system is fit for purpose, whether it is sufficient to capture and ensure actions on welfare concerns raised by students or third parties."

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) In the NAVIGO report of 22nd October 2022 in response to the mother's request as to ""why Vincenzo wasn't sectioned under the Mental Health Act after his detrimental (suicide) attempt on 16th October if only for observation"" the SW replies ""An admission to a mental health unit would not provide a therapeutic benefit as Vinny's social stressors would still be present in the future"". The response does not seem to consider/reflect the admission criteria under s.2 or s.3 of the MHA. Please clarify the rational as the family believe an opportunity has been lost and a death could have been averted. In addition, the recommendation was for a face-to-face meeting with the deceased. Please explain why LPFT made only a telephone call on 17th October when if face to face observations and a more effective analysis had been undertaken particularly after the recent suicide attempts a more effective analysis could have been undertaken.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. In June 2020 the Independent Office for Police Complaints recommended that all response vehicles be equipped with a ligature cutter or similar. That recommendation was accepted by Chief Superintendent Clare Evans on behalf of South Wales Police in July 2020. I received evidence from Chief Inspector that in 2020 South Wales Police had determined to widen the scope of the recommendation to all frontline officers. She informed me that ligature cutters were delivered to the force in July 2022. As at the 4th of October 2022, approximately 25% of those had been distributed to frontline officers. Coronerôs Office, The Old Courthouse, Courthouse Street, Pontypridd, CF37 1JW She was unable to assist the court with the timeline for the remaining distribution other than in relation to her own force division - a target date of the 22nd of October 2022. She candidly accepted in her evidence that the incomplete distribution to all frontline officers at this time meant that the scenario faced by the response officers attending upon Mr White on the 20th of October 2019 was still patent & the opportunity to release a suspended individual currently dependent upon whether there had been distribution to the tasked response officers. That is the concern that I have and wish you to consider and address. 2. A collateral concern, not directly causative of Mr Whiteôs death, arose during the inquest and which I also wish to bring to your attention. This concerns the availability of bespoke training to response officers in relation to handling similar situations faced by the officers on the 20th of October 2019. The three attending officers on 20.10.19 indicated that they had not received specific training (notwithstanding the evidence I received from retired Detective Chief inspector that he had prepared a video for officers covering this type of scenario as part of mental health awareness training in 2017) to assist them in managing the scenario they faced. Retired Detective Chief Inspector indicated that he had delivered training that year to officers within the force for the purposes of cascading the same widely. Given both the statistical and anecdotally evidenced increase in mental health crisis incidents (on occasions resulting in death) that your officers are required to attend, I believe that it would be of benefit to those officers who have not received this bespoke training, (as well, perhaps those who may benefit from refreshing their knowledge) for consideration to be given to reinstating the same and expediting its delivery widely ì i.e. to all frontline staff. I would stress that the two immediate response officers cannot be, nor indeed were, criticised in their individual interactions with Mr White on the 20th of October 2019. Indeed, and without the apparent benefit of the training, they interacted with Mr White in accordance with the approach advocated by retired Detective Chief inspector ."

His Honour Judge Thomas Teague QC, The Chief Coroner for England and Wales.","From the evidence I received, at the inquest, there are matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1) On completion of the inquest, I found the decision to rescind detention under s.2 on 25/3/19 was undermined in two essential respects: a) A failure to update a suicide self-harm risk assessment. b) A failure to formulate a Care and Treatment plan identifying core treatment needs. 2 A Serious Incident Investigation (SII), commissioned by CNWL, completed on 9/9/2019, investigated the Risk Assessment element and made recommendations which I heard from a CNWL witness had subsequently been implemented and I am satisfied that this risk to life has been satisfactorily reduced. However, I remain concerned that the Care and Treatment plan aspect was not identified by the SII and as such no recommendations were identified and followed up. The psychiatrist who rescinded s.2, on 25/3/2019, was unable to participate in the inquest through illness. As a result, I instructed an independent expert psychiatrist who gave evidence that there had been no treatment plan addressing Danielôs core treatment needs. The core treatment needs were that Daniel required antipsychotic medication to control his delusional beliefs and psychological intervention to address his substance misuse which exacerbated his delusional beliefs. The expert also identified from statements and medical records that Daniel lacked insight into his mental health conditions and thereby lacked capacity. The treatment Daniel required was twofold. Assertive treatment of the delusional disorder with antipsychotics, whilst detained under s.2, to achieve stability, coupled with psychological therapy to address the illicit drug use. I heard evidence that antipsychotics could not commence until the results of liver function tests were available, but this did not persuade the expert, that recission of s.2 was correct. The psychiatrist who rescinded s.2 on 25/3/19 was interviewed by the SII but the care and treatment plan aspect was not explored by that investigation. My concern is that failures in the formulation of a Care and Treatment Plan made a significant contribution to the death and this failing was not exposed until the inquest when it could have been identified much earlier by the SII in September 2019. The fact that a Care and Treatment plan was not formulated gives me concern that the mistake could be repeated in future and my concern is compounded by the SII failing to investigate and make recommendations arising from this issue. Accordingly, I am reporting this matter to the Minister for Health and CNWL Trust to make such recommendations as they see fit arising from the expert evidence uncovered by the inquest so that any necessary lessons can be learned. 2) My second concern is the poor contemporaneous documentation of the grant of unescorted leave from the hospital and the time taken to alert the police when Daniel failed to return on 26/3/19 by 21:00 pm. A ward nurse eventually contacted the police after midnight. i) I am concerned that an earlier call to the police may have prevented the death, because Daniel was recorded on General Security Zone (GSZ) cameras at 22:21 leaving Vauxhall bridge, and returning, on foot at 23:48. An earlier call might have enabled police to intervene before he was able to commence the actions which ended his life. ii) The ward manager claimed in evidence that he had instructed others to call the police when Daniel failed to return at 21:00. However, this was not documented anywhere in the medical records and a leave book with handwritten entries went missing after the death. The missing leave book was not investigated by the SII. 3 iii) A nurse who called the police, sometime before 00:30 according to the medical records, or at 01:10 according to police records, was not interviewed by the SII. I found these investigative deficits troubling because the learning of lessons in patient care depends, in part, on an early SII by the hospital concerned so that risks to patient safety can be identified to enable recommendations and improvements long before an inquest conclusion. The delay in reporting the failure to return to the Ward was a factor that contributed to the dangerous situation already created by rescinding s.2. I am nonetheless concerned that, in general, psychiatric patients being tested on voluntary leave are a vulnerable group and as such failures to return should be reported with expedition not only because they may be a danger to themselves, but also due to a risk of being preyed upon by others. I therefore wish to report this matter to the Minister for Health and CNWL Trust to make such recommendations as they see fit including the adequacy of the SII investigation."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The inquest started on Tuesday 11 October 2022 and concluded today, Friday 14 October 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Charley Ann Patterson Deceased suffered with low mood and anxiety related to a number of factors including the restrictions in place due to COVID-19, relationship difficulties with peers and other influences. She had suffered bullying in the period leading up to her death through electronic means. She shared two known previous instances of self-harm involving cutting to her arms which were superficial in nature. She voluntarily attended Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington with her mother at approximately 20.00 hours on 29th May 2020 after she had self-harmed for the second time a few days prior. She was assessed and promptly referred to and seen by the Psychiatric Liaison Team at approximately 21.30 hours. There ∑ were superficial cuts to the left arm which did not require medical intervention and she wanted support with her anxiety and low self-esteem and to learn positive coping strategies for times of emotional distress due to a number of factors. As part of the discharge plan on 29 May 2020 she was referred to the Young Persons Universal Crisis Team and an assessment with them took place upon agreement via telephone on 1 June 2020. She did not meet the criteria for referral to Children and Young Peoples Service as she did not present with a significant degree of psychological dis tress or mental health difficulty. She was discharged with support netting and a plan where it was discussed and agreed with her and her mother that there would be a referral to the Northumberland (Early Help) Hub. No referral to the Northumberland (Early Help) Hub was made. There was no referral to the mental health trust saf eguarding team and there was an absence of communication 2 < Andrew Hetherington HM Senior Coroner for North Northumberland and Acting Senior Coroner for South Northumberland Northumberiand Coroner's Court county Hal, = Northumberland NESY 2EF REGULATION 28: REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS ""REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS ","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) During the course of the inquest, it was a concern to me the increase in the number of children and young people who are now being seen with regard to their emotional well- being, psychological distress and mental health difficulties which have impacted on them requiring support and assessment since the Coronavirus pandemic and the delays that now exist before they receive treatment and support. (2) I heard that in 2020 if the criteria for referral had been met for referral to Children's Adolescent Mental Health Services there would have been a triage of the child or young person within 8 weeks, treatment within up to 19 weeks with the number of referrals at that time being 1,595. In 2022, subject to meeting the criteria for referral, there would be a triage of the child or young person within 3 weeks but that the waiting time for treatment has increased from up to 19 weeks to up to 63 weeks with the number of referrals being 2,275. (3) I heard evidence from Cramlington Learning Village where Charley was a pupil and they told me since Charley's death they have strengthened their support for children suffering from anxiety and other mental health issues by increasing the mental health learn, employing two emotional literacy teaching assistants, a Mental Health and Well Being Practitioner, another Thrive Practitioner and increased the number of Deputy Safeguarding Leads to 5. (4) I heard from a Paediatric Nurse Practitioner who is based in the Accident and Emergency at Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington who told me in evidence that in 2020 it was the case that she would see a referral from a child or young person struggling with emotional distress, anxiety, mental health difficulties and instances of self-harm and overdose once a week but that since the Coronavirus pandemic the incidence of assessments for children and young people with those issues has risen from once per week to once per shift. I also heard from the Group Nurse Director forCumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust in the North Locality who told me that in May 2020 she would see 100 referrals a month from children experiencing anxiety and mental health difficulties but in May 2022 the number of referrals has increased to 300 children per month. The reason for the referrals is complex but includes the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic with staff seeing an increase in demand in the numbers of young people suffering with anxiety, low self-esteem, bod image, OCD and instances of self-harm and overdose. (5) I ask for there to be an assessment of the services and resources that can be offered to meet the increase in demand in the number of children and young people seeking support with regard to their emotional well-being, psychological distress and mental health difficulties which have impacted on them since the Coronavirus pandemic and to reduce the delay in receiving early support in order to avoid a mental health crisis. wil othe sens and professionals though i nal posaeto aay Whose refers land steps had boon undertaken whether the aUicome would have been any deren Corsiopurmonary esunotaton was commenced, and paramedis arives, and a retun of spontaneous Ceaiation was achieved.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Maxôs father told me at inquest that in March and April 2022, Max tried to contact his personal advisor at the 18+ Service at Thistley Hill in Dover on several occasions over a number of weeks, but found her phone always to be switched off. There was no redirect and no out of office on her email. Maxôs father also tried to call her, with the same result. Just over a week after Maxôs death, his family received a letter addressed to him from Kent Social Services, explaining that his social worker was off sick. A crisis number was given and Mr Turbutt called it, but it was simply an answerphone. This arrangement does not seem adequate for a vulnerable person in need."

At the incident location there is little if anything by way of safety measures that would prevent anyone from being able to climb over, around or on top of the side railings of the bridge or to prevent them from jumping from the bridge to the carriageway. There is for example no enclosure of the walkway to prevent this. 2. At the incident location there are no means of summonsing help or calling for help should a person be in crisis and require assistance. There are no signs or signposting for mental health assistance or support (such as from Samaritans). 3. There are no known monitored CCTV cameras covering the bridge or approach area, rendering monitoring of a recognised danger spot actionless. 4. At the incident location, according to Hampshire Police Record Management Systems, there have been 12 crisis incidents in the last 5 years (of which the Police are aware) - including 7 self-harm ( jumping) attempts, 2 successful jumps from which the individual has survived and 3 fatalities. There have been a further 89 reported 'concern for safety' incidents at the location. 5. Wider reports of self-harm incidents and fatalities are well known from most of which do not have sufficent safety measures in place (as above) or means of summonsing help at a point of mental health crisis. 6. Deaths continue to occur as a result of individuals jumping from these bridges and insufficient measures have so far been taken to address and prevent their occurrance."

I recommend that consideration is given to the setting up of an independent regulatory body to monitor on-line platform content with particular regard to the above. I recommend that consideration is given to enacting such legislation as may be necessary to ensure the protection of children from the effects of harmful on-line content and the effective regulation of harmful on-line content.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. The ward layout did not lend itself to easy observation of patients. The Courtôs expert considered it wholly inadequateô. The jury felt that this contributed more than minimally to Katharineôs death. A number of rooms (including Katharineôs room, 23) were remote from the nursing station and largely out of sight unless visited for a specific purpose. Whilst I am aware that some changes have been made since 2018, I am concerned that the current layout continues to place vulnerable patients, who might take their own lives, at risk. It is appreciated that the Trust might not be in a positon to create a ward which eliminates all of the layout issues. However, mitigation measures might be appropriate if the present facilities are to be used on an ongoing basis in an unmodified form. I am concerned that the limitations presented by the current layout may mean that staffing levels need to be adjusted to allow for greater levels of informal observation, oversight and monitoring. 2. The argument with her husband was a trigger event for Katharine. She was seen briefly by some ward staff between her return to the ward at around 10:25 and 11:00, but left completely unattended between 11:00-12:00. The jury felt that there was a missed opportunity at this time to affect the outcome and that the assessment of the risk that Katharine posed to herself had been inadequate. The evidence indicated that ward staff (seemingly regardless of their level of experience and seniority) who attend a patient in a situation like this are left to determine what (if any) action to take based upon their clinical judgement. In particular, it is left to the individual to decide whether escalation to a senior clinician would be appropriate and whether observations or monitoring (or even simply staying with the patient) should be increased for a period of time. I was told that it would not be unworkable in any scenario such as this (involving knowledge of a trigger event in the case of an impulsive patient with a known history of suicide attempts and self-harm) for there to be a procedure which called for an automatic review by the senior clinician on the ward at the time. However, that is not the current situation. I am concerned that, in the absence of a clear protocol, relatively junior staff (who may not be able to effect an adequate risk assessment) may not be equipped to determine how best to address the short-term risk."

NHS England,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) is a charity whose services are often commissioned by the NHS. As a charity, BPAS does not have direct access to NHS perinatal psychiatrists. Referrals would have to be made either via the patientôs GP or via an unwieldy safeguarding concern (as happened in this case). Referrals via the GP are not possible where the patient does not wish their identity to be revealed. It is a matter of concern that there is no direct access for BPAS patients who are suffering from pregnancy related mental health decline, to peri-natal psychiatry teams. Direct and confidential access to peri-natal psychiatry teams may reduce the risk of future deaths."

Consideration should be given as to efficacy of such a policy and whether this can be improved by recognising that some items of clothing will be more obvious ligature risks and may need to be removed in all cases. Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to address the above concerns."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1) During his initial healthcare screening appointment on the evening he arrived at HMP Hewell ( 25.3.21 ) and his secondary healthcare screening appointment the following day, Mr. McDonald denied any mental health issues, and denied any current thoughts of suicide or self-harm. His community GP records were 2 requested and were received by the prison on 30.3.21; these showed a previous history of depression, and two previous drug overdoses, the most recent of which had been only 7 months earlier; 2) Despite this history, no appointment was made with Mr. McDonald by the healthcare or mental healthcare teams to follow this up with him, and discuss his mental health in more depth; 3) In his evidence to the inquest, the current Head of Healthcare at the prison conceded that it might have been appropriate for someone to have visited Mr. McDonald, raised with him what the GP summary had shown, and asked him if he would like any help, but that he would only have expected any such follow- up if there had been any current concerns about his mental health. He further confirmed that there would have been no automatic follow-up about this, even if staff believed that Mr. McDonald may have deliberately misled them about his mental health history during his healthcare screening appointments; 4) In subsequent correspondence to my office, the Head of Healthcare has suggested that it might be appropriate to delay a prisonerôs secondary healthcare screening appointment until his GP records have been obtained and scrutinised, so that concerns about any history set out in those records can be raised with the prisoner. That proposal is due to be raised at the prisonôs next Local Quality Assurance Meeting; 5) I am concerned that there is currently no system in place at HMP Hewell to follow up with a prisoner any discrepancy between the mental health history which he has disclosed on arrival at the prison, and that revealed in his community GP records. Experience suggests that a prisoner with a recorded history of mental health issues, particularly one which includes a recent episode of attempted suicide or self-harm through overdose, may be at his most vulnerable during his first days and weeks at a prison, and having been reluctant to disclose such issues for any number of reasons ( e.g. fear, embarrassment ), may be reassured to be told that healthcare staff at the prison are aware of that history and can provide confidential support. In my view, without routine follow-up in such cases, there remains a significant risk that a prisonerôs recent significant history of suicide or self-harm may be overlooked in those important early days and weeks in prison, and that such prisoners will therefore be at an increased risk of further episodes of attempted suicide during that period."

The first bed that became available for an older adult was on 28 April 2022 which was the day that Mr Tice took his own life. In addition to the lack of an available bed, the evidence was that Mr Tice required psychotherapy of a type that was over and above the service provided by mental health practitioners offering psychological support on the ward and in the community.

CORONERôS LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 1st April 2021, Andrew Bridgman, Assistant Coroner, opened an inquest into the death of Mr Christopher Michael Lloyd, who died at his home on 14th March 2021, aged 32 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I heard between 15th ì 17th August 2022. In the light of a Post Mortem examination, the inquest determined that Mr Lloyd died as a consequence of hanging. The conclusion of the inquest as to Mr Lloydôs death was one of Suicide. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Lloyd died at his home having suspended himself by the neck with a ligature. Mr Lloyd had a long history of poor mental health, and considered himself to have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He also had a significant history of substance misuse, and at various points throughout his life had been known to use alcohol, cocaine and cannabis in a potentially detrimental manner. Mr Lloyd had also been known to take although these medicines were not prescribed to him. At the time of his death, Mr Lloydôs key treatment goal was to be abstinent from all substances and to have an assessment of his mental health. CORONERôS CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. ì 1. Whilst Mr Lloyd had some interactions with mental health services, and was under the care of a charity who provides support as a consequence of alcohol and drug addiction, it is a matter of concern that he did not have ready access to a dual-diagnosis service locally. A unified service of this nature, employing appropriate specialists, would have the benefit of being able to assess and treat mental-health conditions existing alongside substance misuse issues in a coherent and holistic manner. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) is a charity whose services are often commissioned by the NHS. As a charity, BPAS does not have direct access to NHS perinatal psychiatrists. Referrals would have to be made either via the patientôs GP or via an unwieldy safeguarding concern (as happened in this case). Referrals via the GP are not possible where the patient does not wish their identity to be revealed. It is a matter of concern that there is no direct access for BPAS patients who are suffering from pregnancy related mental health decline, to peri-natal psychiatry teams. Direct and confidential access to peri-natal psychiatry teams may reduce the risk of future deaths."

CORONERôS LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5/paragraph/7 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 29th September 2021, an inquest was opened into the death of Dr Lee Winslow, who died at his home on 12th June 2021, aged 56 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which I heard on 28th July 2022. The inquest determined that Dr Winslow died as a consequence of toxicity. The conclusion of the inquest as to Dr Winslowôs death was one of Suicide. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Dr Winslow was found dead at his home on 12th June 2021 having taken with the intention of ending his life. The inquest determined that, whilst the had probably been taken from one of the hospitals where he worked, the had been taken from Manchester Royal Infirmary. In August 2020, Dr Winslow had previously attempted to end his life by taking an overdose of Aside from the which had been left over from a previous prescription, Dr Winslow freely admitted having taken the remainder of these medicines from Trust stocks. Following this overdose, Dr Winslow was absent from the Trust on sick-leave until 14th December 2020. After a period of supervised practice, Dr Winslow returned to unrestricted duties in the week commencing 18th January. CORONERôS CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. Following the admission by Dr Winslow in 2020 that he had taken medicines from the Trust with a view to ending his life, it is a matter of concern that the case was not formally referred to the Police and the General Medical Council. Making such referrals would have had the potential benefit of:- i) Providing the Trust with ready access to external advice as to the adequacy (or otherwise) of steps taken to mitigate the future risk of staff members misappropriating medicines with a view to self-harming; and ii) Offered access to a mechanism whereby objective analysis of Dr Winslowôs fitness to practise as a Consultant Anaesthetist (both from a health and broader perspective) could have taken place; 2. In December 2020, the Trust became aware that, whilst on sick leave from the NHS, Dr Winslow had continued with his private practice notwithstanding an explicit instruction from his manager to the effect that he should refrain from all work. It is a further matter of concern that this development did not, of itself, cause the Trust to reconsider its position and make the referrals set out above; 3. In the absence of any meaningful external review of the case as a whole, it is a particular concern that most of the actions which followed the theft of medication by Dr Winslow in 2020 appear to have been taken as a result of decisions made by members of the Trustôs medical hierarchy. In view of the gravity of the issues raised by Dr Winslowôs misappropriation of drugs in 2020, and the previous suicide of a Consultant Anaesthetist employed by the Trust involving misuse of prescription medicines, it is a matter of concern that a more multi-disciplinary approach was not taken, perhaps overseen by someone such as a non-executive director of the organisation. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 12th October 2022. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

When discharged from hospital on the 7th May 2021 it was noted that he had been consuming a bottle of whiskey per day. On the 19th May Mr Moore was prescribed following a telephone conversation between a paramedic attending upon Mr Moore and a doctor at the surgery. iv. On the 21st May Mr Mooreôs sister wrote to the surgery summarising her concerns for her brother and querying the medication that he had been prescribed. The surgery had no consent from Mr Moore to release any information to his sister.

I would request consideration is given as to the advice to be given in the circumstances where a patient is not being seen face to face, but via another healthcare worker. iii. Further, consideration should be given to the amount and dosage that should be prescribed in these circumstances and 3 whether there should be a documented process to highlight any concerns about the use of being brought to the patientôs attention as soon as possible. iv.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) Robyn was failed by the Mental Health Services quite frankly due to the current lack of resourcing and provision in place to support young people struggling with their mental health. Due to the lack of availability of a Child Psychiatrist there are long waiting times for children to be assessed. Robyn was not seen by a Child Psychiatrist and/or Psychologist, despite there being a need for this to happen, thereby enabling her to be diagnosed and receive a treatment plan. Robynôs parents did everything they could during this period to support Robyn, including paying for a private counsellor, but sadly Robynôs mental health continued to deteriorate during this time, and she took her own life. Robyn initial acceptance into tier 3 Children and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) similarly did not happen in a timely manner.

Requests were made by email and CAD, without discussions between officers. This was confirmed in the evidence of Detective Chief Constable of SP, who stated that from her perspective there was a lack of feedback from SP to manage MPSô expectations regarding a search for Mr Boughton. In respect of the initial search, this meant that SP did not advise MPS that they considered the search request unfeasible given the extent of land outlined and the limitations on searching wooded areas during winter night hours. In respect of the request for a further search with more precise location detailed provided, MPS did not disclose all of the information available 3 RT4563 regarding Family and friends potentially being able to assist in finding the location based upon where Mr Boughton used to visit. There was no feedback from SP regarding when a search might take place, leading MPS to consider deploying its own search team. Whilst contact telephone numbers for Officers at MPS and SP were provided on the CAD, there is no evidence that direct contact was made between the forces to discuss the investigation and how best to move this forward. A SP officer recorded on the CAD that until the transfer document was received from MPS, SP were unable to arrange a search or contact the specialist search team. Whilst DI gave evidence that he is aware the NPCC is reviewing issuing guidance around tasking and transfers between bordering Police forces, at present there appears to be no requirement for appropriate Police Officers to make telephone contact between forces to ensure effective tasking and transferring, in addition to the required written requests. This means an opportunity to discuss and pass on all relevant information between forces may be lost. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: 1. The lack of any detailed requirement for telephone discussion between appropriate police officers on sending through written tasking requests and considering transfers of investigation means that an opportunity to discuss and ensure smooth transition and passing on of relevant information is lost. This may cause delay in effective action being taken by the tasked Force, or (in the case of transfers) by the Force to whom it is considered a transfer will be made. Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to address the above concerns."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì From the evidence I heard, the Care Coordinatorôs role is to assess the patientôs care needs and to plan and review those needs across the broad spectrum of physical and mental health and social needs within the multi-disciplinary team within the Mental Health Trust. The Care Coordinator is the individual who has the closest contact with the patient and, as the title suggests, is the liaison link for every other professional and agency. From the evidence, it is clear that an enormous burden of responsibility and reliance is placed on the individual Care Coordinator as they are expected to be the conduit of information to other professionals and to continuously review and assess all areas of the patientôs needs and to call in others as required. I concluded that the only person who had the ability to have a comprehensive view of Ms Flintôs mental health was the Care Coordinator and the quality of the information provided to others within the multi-disciplinary team and other agencies was entirely dependent on the ability, availability, resources, experience, training and skills of the Care Coordinator. (1) From the evidence, it appeared that the precise job description and requirements of Care coordinators differs between local Trusts so that there is no consistency as to the way in which individual Care coordinators are expected to fulfil their role. (2) It also emerged that the resources available to the Community Mental Health Teams are limited so that in the absence of a Care Coordinator during periods of annual leave or sickness, there was no other Care Coordinator who could fulfil the role."

Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Department of Health and Social Care, 39 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0EU, in respect of Item One of the Matters of Concern; 2. , Chief Executive Officer, Priory, Floor 5 Hammersmith Road, London W14 8UD, in respect of Item Two of the Matters of Concern.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì Matter One The inquest heard that the Priory had identified that the garden fence was a risk, in particular the section over the door, in about December 2019. There had been a number of escapes both over the fence and through it, in the months leading up to Jamesô escape. The number of escapes indicates that garden area was not safe. There was a plan to replace it but there were other priorities. More striking was that there is no national guidance for perimeter fencing and security for the outside areas of mental health locked wardsô; unlike that in existence for mental health secure unitsô. In particular, the height of the fence. While it is accepted that national guidance ought not be necessary to carry out appropriate risk assessments and ensure secure/safe spaces it is clear that such guidance is necessary to ensure the correct level of security for vulnerable patients, whilst benefitting from the therapeutic setting of an outdoor space. Matter Two The evidence showed that there was no appreciation of the emerging pattern of behaviour. A major contributing factor was the lack of exchange and transfer of information at the handover between the consecutive shifts. In particular, the form specifically designed for this with a section for completion ì Incidents in last 7 daysô which would have provided an information flow through was not completed. Whilst I heard evidence of steps taken to improve information exchange at a higher level than between ward staff (nurses and HCAs) I was very surprised to hear that no audit of these handover documentsô had been carried out. Given the fundamental importance of the exchange of information between each shift and consecutive shifts I am of the opinion that The Priory have not carried out a sufficiently robust review. Until this failure is addressed there is a significant risk of a breakdown in the communication of adverse events across the shift pattern of several days. The risk of a lack of appreciation of an emerging pattern of behaviour remains."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) I was told that the Crisis Recovery and Home Treatment Team (""CRHT"") use the Care Partner records, a whiteboard and a manual diary to enter the various information and action points and that it is at the Multidisciplinary Team meetings that the actions or steps are discussed and progressed. They are either crossed out, if completed, or moved to the next date until they have been actioned. It was highlighted that in this particular case two actions were not completed either prior to Kieranôs discharge from the CRHT or shortly thereafter. In one of these, the entry had been crossed out, giving the impression that the matter had, in fact been dealt with when it had not. This indicated that there was an issue as to the monitoring and execution of such actions or steps. This anomaly whereby a significant step may have been overlooked remains a concern. 5 (2) The evidence I heard from one witness described how she was asked to contact Kieran by telephone and to advise him of the fact that a Multi-agency Referral Form (úMARFù) was to be submitted. I considered this was an inappropriate means of communicating a significant procedure and which could potentially bear on his (or any other vulnerable person's) state of mind. What was unclear is how the provision of this information and step to be taken will be approached in future. (3) I expressed concern that someone having been discharged from the CRHT, there appeared to be no route back into the Mental Health Service short of a re-referral to the CRHT itself via A & E for someone who remains vulnerable by reason of their mental state and who is receiving therapy as part of the discharge plan. This is in the context of someone who was receiving support from the Integrated Psychology Therapy Service (úIPTSù) and the Dyfed Drug and Alcohol Service (úDDASù), both of whom were engaged in providing appropriate therapies. My concern is that there appears to be an issue in relation to lines of communication and information sharing between Primary Mental Health Services and Tier 2 providers of therapy.

It was accepted that he experienced autism and that was part of his individuality and that in addition he may have had a mental health disorder. It was accepted that his care and treatment cannot unbundle the two but he should be treated holistically. 3 Assessment and formulation of risks and safety summary did not fully explore the impact of his autism.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) The post-incident site report presented by British Transport Police (in conjunction with the Design Out Crime Unit) and completed on 22 July 2021 identified that there was (and remains) limited staffing and CCTV surveillance at Portchester Railway Station and limited visibility of the platforms - requiring a security risk assessment with a view to increasing staffing (at the ticket office and on the platform) with increased RCO Patrols and platform surveillance and that additional CCTV installation and coverage was required (of the platforms and public areas) with real time capability. (2) The post-incident site report further identified that Portchester Railway station is an impending escalatedô location. Since 2017 there have been 2 previous fatalities in similar circumstances at the station ì which is now recognised as having lower levels of surveillance ì with Mr Daviesô death being the third. Although recommendations were made after the first incident, the above recommendations and identified risks (at 1) have not yet been (fully) addressed or implemented. (3) The post-incident site report further identified the lack of public security and welfare announcements at the station (and within the station concourse) aimed at providing direction in the event of illness or of assistance being required. There is a lack of information/announcements to other members of the public as to how to obtain assistance if they are concerned by someone elseôs condition or actions.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The evidence at the inquest was that Kate had become depressed for the last 12-18 months of her life. Her family described her as displaying signs of psychosis. Obviously, the causes of the decline in her mental health toward the end of her life were likely complex and multiple. The evidence was however, that she had become particularly disturbed over the 3-4 months immediately prior to her death. Specifically, these symptoms had worsened significantly subsequent to her attendance at a Hands of Light Academy course in Worcestershire; which took place on 18th-22nd June 2021. , . My concern is that hallucinogenic substances are being dispensed by the Hands of Light Academy to attendees on its courses, potentially and/or actually mentally unwell people, without proper, or any, consideration of the impact that they may have on them.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1) (Addressed to Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited, referred to collectively as Nightingalesô) Whereas the court heard evidence that Nightingales would not accept another patient with an equivalent medical profile/history and that, should a resident within one of Nightingalesô homes require access to items to be restricted, they would be given 1:1 support pending a mental health assessment and discharge to a more appropriate facility, it was not possible for the home concerned to advise the court as to how and by whom the lead in question had been returned to Mrs Stringer. The concern arises that, in the case of a resident whose care requires access to items to be restricted, there should be a fail- safe, documented system, known to and implemented by staff, by which access to those items by the resident is prevented. In the circumstances that the possibility of a resident requiring such care may still arise, this concern exists notwithstanding the decisions now made. 2) (Addressed to Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited, referred to collectively as Nightingalesô) The court heard evidence as to the potential detrimental effects of isolation and loneliness in the elderly, including evidence from the court appointed expert that isolation can be very corrosive, that it is the single most potent causative risk factor for depression in the elderly and that it can have a very detrimental effect on a personôs mental state. There is a need for this to be known amongst staff. The concern arises as one member of staff gave (disputed) evidence that they had little or no training in such matters. 3) (Addressed to Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Lancashire County Council, Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited (the latter referred to collectively as Nightingalesô)) The court heard evidence and/or found that a number of steps had not been taken pertaining to the transfer of information concerning Mrs Stringerôs risk of suicide. They included the following: i. The care coordinator should have requested that the acute hospital make a referral to the Mental Health Liaison Team for a review; ii. It would have been good practice for a further professionals meeting / CPA review to have taken place prior to formal discharge and no later than just after discharge to Nightingales and for the family to have been invited, to ensure that everyone was aware of the plan, that the family was aware of Mrs Stringerôs legal status and to discuss next steps in terms of liaison with other services; iii. There should have been greater professional curiosity and better communication at the time of transfer; iv. The Harbour mental health hospitalôs RNNA should have been reviewed to determine whether it needed to be updated and it should have been updated if there was any different clinical information. Further self harm or suicidal ideation, if seen to be significant, should have given rise to a further RNNA; v. There had, in fact, been further indications of self harm and suicidal ideation and, in any event, of a wish to die, on 30th June 2020, in August 2020 and on 3rd September 2020 which were significant and should have been addressed in the information provided to Nightingales and had not been; vi. Mrs Stringer was discharged from The Harbour mental health hospital without an up-to-date Care Act Assessment and, in any event, taking into account the need for Mrs Stringer to be transferred to the acute hospital (which had been necessary), an up-to-date Care Act Assessment had not been completed during the period of her admission to the latter hospital; vii. The risk assessment should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; viii. A positive behaviour support plan should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; ix. A care plan, compliant with CPA Policy and Procedures Key Standard 10, which should have identified a suitable environment in which to manage Mrs Stringerôs risk, her needs and mental health and crisis and contingency planning, to cater for the event of a significant relapse in her mental health, should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; x. Risk behaviour should have been identified to Nightingales and context given, whereas that had not been the case in respect of certain behaviour, including the incident on 30th June 2020; xi. The care coordinator should have been better informed at the points of transfer and discharge; xii. There should have been more robust follow up by the care coordinator whilst Mrs Stringer was at the acute hospital; xiii. There had been no mental health service involvement between the 7-day follow up and 28th September 2020 or, if there had, it had not been recorded; xiv. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not possible for a manager to carry out a face-to-face assessment in the mental health hospital but no equivalent measure had been implemented; xv) Whereas it would have been helpful for Nightingales to have received the Continuing Healthcare Checklist, it had not been provided; xvi) Nightingales would have wished to see the risk of suicide referred to in the úRisks to the Service Userù section of the FACE Overview Assessment; xvii) The court appointed expert had concerns about the accessibility of key information in the FACE Overview Assessment given the format of that document. Whereas the court heard evidence concerning subsequent, significant, purposeful, developments in practice, the matters listed above can be condensed into a single concern that there should be a comprehensive, cohesive, frictionless system for the timely collation (including from the family and/or other carers) and timely communication / transfer of sufficient, accessible information ((not, simply, risk assessments) pertaining to suicide risk in patients / service users / residents, by and between each of the service providers concerned."

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. I heard evidence that following a review in 2015 changes to the ACCT document and process were piloted in 10 establishments in 2019 and this included HMP Swansea. As a result a revised ACCT version 6 and accompanying policy guidance was issued. This revised guidance makes clear that an ACCT must be opened by any member of staff who receives information that indicates a prisoner may be currently at risk of self-harm or suicide and that this information may come from a prison escort. However, this requirement is not new. It was clear in my view from the HMP Swansea Suicide and Prevention Policy that was in place at the time of Khalid's death that a warning marker for suicide on a prison escort record ('PER') should result in the opening of an ACCT. The prison officer who saw Khalid first in reception gave evidence that he was an experienced prison officer with over 20 years-experience of working in prisons including 18 years at HMP Swansea. At the time when Khalid came into custody he was an ACCT assessor and remains in this role. He saw Khalid's PER which stated that Khalid had recently made threats to kill himself and was alleging mental health issues and he saw the NOEMIS transfer report which contained reference to historic ACCTs that Khalid had been on in custody and an act of cutting and ligaturing by Khalid 9 months before in December 2015. He did not open an ACCT but referred to the nurse who also did not open an ACCT. In his evidence the Prison Officer stated that if a prisoner came into custody now in 2022 with a warning on his PER stating that he has recently made threats to kill himself then this would not be enough to trigger the opening of an ACCT. This view is inconsistent with the mandatory revised ACCT policy quidance that I have set out above. This indicates that the system for trainina on 2 úconsidered sue @_| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH úThe deceased was Khalid Abiaz aid was a Somalian asylum seeker with an outstanding asylum appeal who on release from immigration detention in July 2016 experienced homelessness and three fatlempts to take his own fe following which he was detained on each occasion under 2 of the Mental Heath Act 1983 (MHA).

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì The mental health services went through a transformation process during the Covid pandemic. It became apparent that the anticipated level of direct referrals to the service from primary care was many times in excess of those predicted. The expectation was 6 per day, at the peak this rose to 30 and has currently reduced to 13-14 daily, so remains over 100% above the anticipated level. The inquest was advised that the service was failing to meet the service demands due to insufficient capacity. The decision was made to enter this onto the Trustôs risk register, and this remains the situation. The critical features remain a high demand for services and a lack of resources. This court has been told on many occasions that there is an intention for úparityù of mental 2 health services with physical health services, but this is not apparent and the service is unable to meet its obligations now or going forward. This is greater than a úlong waiting listù issue and is not a situation that can be explained exclusively by the covid pandemic. A more significant risk to individuals requiring mental health services has now arisen than existed before the transformation programme; it creates a real concern that lives will be lost as a consequence, and no solution was offered to the court during the inquest. The service is set up to deal with less than half of the referrals that it receives, leading to inevitable failings that currently cannot be rectified."

Mr Nixon was not known to mental health services prior to February 2021. ii. Mr Nixon's accompanied him to every appointment he had with the Home Treatment Team. She had never had dealings with the Mental Health Services previously. iii. Mr Nixon had given permission to the Mental Health Services to share information with . On one occasion it was deemed that a doctor could not impart patient information to Mr Nixon's because he wrongly thought he did not have permission from the patient to do so. iv. Mr Nixon's was unaware that he had disclosed ""occasional suicidal thoughts"" and was therefore unable to assess the risk of Mr Nixon to himself and accordingly did not take any steps to protect him. v. The Care Plan, Escalation Plan, Emergency Plan were not drawn up in writing until after Mr Nixon's death. No paperwork was sent to Mr Nixon (and in turn not seen by his partner) by the Home Treatment Team prior to his death. Mr Nixon's partner was not therefore party to or privy to any risk assessment. vi.

I have received & considered the same. During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) The assessment of Sam's risk of self-harm was recorded by his care-co- ordinator in a Wales Applied Risk Research Network (WARRN) assessment tool in March 2019. This form of assessment was adopted by the Integrated Mental Health Services (Powys County Council & Powys Teaching Health Board) in Powys. I also received evidence that it is used throughout Wales by similar services. (2) The evidence I received indicated that the WARRN assessment documentation/tool could be routinely accessed, updated & revised by the Integrated Team. It was a fluid document for the purpose of recording information as to the current assessment of risk(s) of self-harm & how that risk(s) was to be mitigated. Whilst I received evidence that in practice, such risk assessments were being undertaken with Sam, the WARRN documentation did not necessarily reflect that, nor was it optimally viewable in terms of clearly recording fluctuating presentations & any accompanying re-assessment of risk. (3) It appeared to me that the format/layout of the WARRN tool, its accessibility, & in particular, its ability to provide a user with clear & easily viewable information as to how Sam's risk of self-harm had fluctuated/altered/changed in the months preceding his death, could lead to important information/assessments being lost to a new/infrequent user. This, for example, might be a new care co-ordinator (as in Sam's case), Crisis Team/Community Nurse, or clinician not previously involved with Sam. (4) Given the variety of services involved in Sam's care, this central document, addressing & recording fluctuating risk appeared to me to be a crucial document in the recording of current risk (my emphasis). The ability of those charged with Sam's care to view those fluctuations might be hampered by the current presentation of/access to such information. That could lead to an under- estimation of the current risk & sub-optimal mitigating measures being put in place. (5) The WARRN assessment tool might also benefit from a greater degree of interaction between it & the user. For example, it was clear, on the evidence that Social Worker's, Mental Health Nurses & Clinicians were all busy addressing the needs (& assessing risk) of a wide number & variety of patients. Prompting (my emphasis) the user to consider & record referrals for, for example, to advocacy services & for capacity assessments might optimise the benefits of the tool & reduce the risk of such opportunities being missed/un-recorded. Such then leading to the potential absence of key information for new/infrequent users when assessing risks of self-harm It may well be helpful (given the Integrated Services approach to Mental Health Services in Powys) if I were to receive one jointly prepared response from both organisations to whom this Report has been sent. 2 CORONER'S"

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Louise Allen did not receive a care plan that was adequate to address the high-risk of harm to herself. This was largely due to failings in the co-ordination of her care. The Inquest heard that care co-ordinators are fundamental to the safe provision of care for high-risk service users. Concerns heard during the evidence at the inquest include: 1. There is a need within the Trust for better continuity of care. There are not enough care co-ordinators to ensure that continuity of care is provided. There are high turnovers of staff. 2. Efforts need to be made to make the post of care co-ordinator more attractive. The evidence heard that the pay within North East London Foundation Trust is not comparable to other Trusts. 3. Care Co-ordinators within the Trust are currently carrying excessive caseloads. 4. There has been an increase in the number of referrals coming into the service. There has been no commensurate increase in the number of care co-ordinators. 5.

Evidence was given at the inquest that at the time of Deanôs passing, there were issues accessing second (s.12) doctors out of office hours for the purpose of carrying out a MHA assessment, resulting in delays to MHA assessments being carried out. The EDT explained that since Deanôs passing, a ús.12 Solutionsù App has been introduced, and although this had made a significant improvement, issues still exist trying to access a second doctor out of hours, as the EDT is still wholly reliant on second doctors making themselves available after midnight (with no fixed rota). 2. Evidence was given at the inquest that at the time of Deanôs passing, there were issues securing the timely attendance of the private ambulance service (ERS Medical) to transport patients after a MHA assessment had taken place, potentially resulting in an increased risk to both the AMHP and the patient for MHA assessments in the community. The EDT advised that since Deanôs passing, despite spot purchasing of private ambulances being introduced, issues still exist trying to get the private ambulance to attend a MHA assessment in a timely manner. 3.

Her medical records recorded that. 2 In or about 2016 she was wrongly attributed by the Mental Health Service, TEWV, clinicians who knew of her autism -as undergoing Emotionally Unstable Personality - Disorder (úEUPDô} 3 That attribution was not formally diagnosed, and not discussed with Zoe who found out by chance when looking at her records. She continued to be regarded and treated as if she was experiencing that condition and clinicians would not adapt to her distress caused by that attribution. There was inertia and excessive delay (to May 2020) in removing reference to EUPD which had been discounted in October 2018 all of which added to her distress. These actions and inactions destroyed her relationship with community mental health clinicians and she did not trust them enough to try to restore any effective care relationship. 4 She suffered repeated trauma derived from her autistic condition revisiting the causes of her distress which she re-experienced time and again with film reelô recollection. That trauma was again not understood. 5 In short, her autism (and thus risk assessment) was misunderstood by the clinicians tasked to keep her safe. 6 TEWVs provision for cares of autistic conditions were underdeveloped, reflecting national want of provision, to include:- A no multidisciplinary clinical assessment and formulation addressed her autism; B no reasonable adjustments were then made in terms of her sensory and environmental needs in any timely fashion, or at all; C no person centred (thus autism centred) holistic plan was developed to work in partnership with Zoe that took account of her autism, and her gender.

D there was no local provision within TEWV for specialist autism assessment and adapted psychological therapy. Commissioned providers of these essential cares were outwith TEWV, requiring specific Funding Request (which was granted) for a course of assessment and therapy. Those providers did not offer statutory acute mental health services support, including out of hours/crisis support. TEWV did not provide what the commissioned providers were supplying. There was a want of effective communications between these teamsô not least as patient data was not accessible by one to the others electronic records (patient consent permitting) and the fact of disengagement. There was a sense of siloô working, militating against partnership working, that encouraged unfavourably the undesirable úuncouplingô of experiences; E statistical evidence indicated that autistic individuals are more at risk of suicide than those with no neurodevelopmental condition, and females at greater risk that their male counterparts; 2 OFFICIAL SENSITIVE During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matiors giving rise To concern Inmy opinion there isa risk thal future deaths Could occur unless action is taken.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) Evidence given at the inquest revealed that Emma was wearing items of clothing manufactured by your company which are made in such a way as to reduce the risk of using the clothing to self harm. The evidence heard that the clothing was commonly referred to as úanti clothingù, or úsafety clothingù as well as úseclusion wearù. It was clear from the evidence that the product was made to reduce the risk of self harm and could not eliminate the risk and that wearers still required supervision. However, in practice it may have provided some reassurance to staff that could not be made from the clothing. (2) Evidence was heard that Emma had sadly somehow managed to use components of her anti clothing to form a ligature to end her life. (3) The evidence given at the inquest was clear that since the notification of Emmaôs death your company have gone to considerable efforts and are to be commended in relation to the changes you have made to your product to further reduce the risk of the products being used to self harm. (4) Further evidence was given that some of the products like those Emma wore are still in circulation and whilst Cygnet are aware and possibly NHS Providers via Cygnet reporting the issue to them there remain risks that users of those products may use them in the same way. This risk may be increased following the publication of the circumstances of Emmaôs death. (5) At the inquest evidence from your company indicated that you were still considering what, if any, action may be required regarding the items manufactured prior to the changes which remain in circulation."

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Evidence was given that: 1. James had accessed a forum on the internet known to promote suicide. That website and the forum discussions attached to it provided advice and guidance on: (i) Appropriate drugs/medication which would produce a terminal result; (ii) Which drugs were most effective; (iii) How they should be taken; (iv) How they could be purchased;. (v) End of life planning. 2. James was careful and methodical in the actions he took to end his life. He appeared to follow some guidance on the steps to take from a úhandbookù which the family believe was generated from a suicide promoting website and his decision to acquire the pentobarbital medication was informed by the that website. 3. The suicide promoting website appeared to act as a trigger in his decision to take his own life. I am concerned that: 3 (a) There are websites and forums which openly promote and advertise methods of suicide which are easily accessible; (b) Suicide is the largest cause of death for individuals in the UK under the age of 35 and James Forryan is within that age bracket; (c) There does not appear to be sufficient regulation or enforcement action against such websites which promote criminal offences and/or harmful content."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (1) I heard evidence from the Suicide Prevention Manager for Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd that training on dealing with vulnerable persons was not mandatory for frontline staff. In fact only 583 out of 7,500 staff had attended a course run by the Samaritans entitled Managing Suicidal Contacts, 40% had completed some e-learning and an unknown number had completed an internal course. In addition refresher training on this issue was an aspiration only and had not been rolled out by Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd. I also heard evidence that the Suicide Prevention Manager for Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd did not have any input into the training for their team based in the joint control room. I am therefore concerned that those members of staff most likely to have contact with vulnerable or suicidal persons, as well as those responsible for assisting frontline staff, are not all properly trained to deal with the situation in the best possible way. (2) I heard evidence that Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd staff control room staff relied upon a protocol entitled Person ill on a trainô when a vulnerable person was reported to them. The witness responsible for the Govia Thameslink Railway control room team accepted that this was not an appropriate document to rely upon as it made no mention of vulnerable persons. I am therefore concerned that the control room staff do not have the appropriate information to assist their colleagues and to arrange an appropriate response when a concern for welfareô report is made to them. (3) I heard evidence that the Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd control room staff did not log all actions taken after the concern for welfare report. I am concerned that it is not possible to assess whether all reasonable and appropriate actions were taken by the control room staff and whether individuals or teams have further training needs.

CORONERôS LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3. INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 15/03/2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Theo Jude BRENNAN-HULME aged 21. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 09/02/2022. The medical cause of death was: 1a) Hanging by the Neck 1b) 1c) 1d) 2 The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide. The mental health assessment carried out on 28 February 2019 was inadequate. 4. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Theo Brennan Hulme had a diagnosis of Aspergerôs Syndrome and a history of deliberate self-harm. Theo was a student at the University of East Anglia from September 2018. He referred himself to the Wellbeing Team on 25 September with low mood and depression and he attended Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital on 26 September 2018 with a history of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Contact was made with Theoôs mother who came to be with Theo who decided to continue at university. He was referred to the Youth Mental Health Team. Theo was discharged from the service without being seen or spoken to. On 26 January 2019 Theo became distressed and had thoughts of suicide following his taking drugs and consuming alcohol. An appointment with the Wellbeing Service arranged for 31 January 2019 was cancelled due to staff sickness and rearranged for 6 March 2019. On 28 February 2019 Theo sought help from the University General Practitioner Service and was referred as an emergency to the community Mental Health Service. He had had thoughts of stabbing himself or drinking bleach. The referral time for an emergency is 4 hours. Theo was seen at 8 hours due to service demands. He was assessed at Hellesdon Hospital. Theo presented with a deterioration in his mental state and with suicidal ideation. He was concerned about his future accommodation, relationships and his university workload. The assessment took at most 41 minutes. Reasonable adjustments were not made to take into account Theoôs diagnosis of Aspergerôs Syndrome, contact was not made with Theoôs family and he was not referred to the Mental Health Home Treatment Team to enable treatment options to be explored. Theo did not attend the Wellbeing Service appointment on 6 March 2019. This was not followed up by the Service. On 9 March Theo exchanged text messages and attended a social event when he did not indicate his intention to take his own life. On 12 March 2019 Theoôs room was forcibly entered following concerns being raised for his welfare. Theo was found hanging and was declared dead at the scene. 5. CORONERôS CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The matters of concern are as follows: 1. Evidence was heard of a historic culture of bullying and harassment within the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team which has led to a loss of compassion in some instances with the view that some suicides are úinevitableù and some reluctance to recognise when cases should be referred to the Team. Work has been undertaken by the Trust to improve such cultural attitudes. However, it was recognised in evidence that there is ústill a distance to goù and areas where the culture needs to change. It is of concern that this culture remains three years following Theoôs death 2. Following an Assessment, a person is still discharged from the Community Team without any immediate úcheckù or discussion as to the correctness of this decision. It was heard that following Theoôs death immediate discharge from the Community Team following assessment is relatively rare. In these circumstances, such a discussion would not place an onerous burden on the Team and would enable a review of the discharging decision to be undertaken to ensure it is the correct decision. 6. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action. 7. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 08 April 2022. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

He was in contact with a significant number of agencies many of which focused on the risk that Matthew posed to others. However, the evidence before me, particularly that of the Salford Safeguarding Board indicates that no -one saw Matthew as the vulnerable adult he was and addressed how his own complex needs were to be met, either through a Care Act assessment or any other means. , on behalf of the Safeguarding Board who conducted a Safeguarding Adult Review told the Inquest that there was no one person or agency co-ordinating his support and care, meaning that Matthew did not have a single point of contact to help him understand and navigate the services being offered to him. This became particularly concerning when Matthewôs mental health declined, making him more erratic and difficult to contact. This left already stretched services to do what they could to pull information together from their own resources or conversations with other agencies. Without proper co-ordination, there was no full information sharing, joint assessment, or joint planning of Matthewôs support, which meant there was never a full appreciation of the risk he posed to himself, and no real care plan was in place to manage that risk. Without a clear pathway for agencies to jointly assess and co-ordinate care in the case of adults with complex mental health and social care needs, I am concerned that future deaths will occur.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - 1. The Court heard evidence that the mental health ward environment could be 'chaotic' (in the words ofone Consultant Psychiatrist) and that resources and demands on inpatient beds were such that staffwere not always able to care for patients in a suitable environment. It is a matter of concern that mental health patients are, on occasion, cared for in an environment which is very obviously not conducive to recovery. 2. The Court heard that patients continue to experience lengthy waits if referred for psychological therapies, both locally and nationally. In the Tameside area, the current average wait was thought to be around one year from referral."

In the crcumstances its my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are that On 6 September 2017 th prescribed him Zopiclone, Ven!afaxine and Propanolol. 2. On 26 September 2017 the deceased saw Dr A. Dr A decided to change his medication and prescribed him Duloxetine and Zolpidem. 3. On 5 October 2017 the deceased saw Dr A again. The Zolpidem was swapped to Nitrazepam, a more potent sedative, as the deceased had said that after 2 weeks he had not found theÔøΩ effective. Expert evidence adduced at the inquest from___. was to the effect that the deceased's presentation at thisÔøΩd have triggered a further inquiry into his psychiatric history ...... said that he would have contacted the deceased's home GP. 4. On ' 19 October 2017 the deceased saw Dr A again. He said he was feeling better on the Duloxetine but was still stressed and anxious and got a few anxiety attacks. Dr A prescribed him Propanol, Nitrazepam and Xanax. Dr A also prescribed the deceased 6 months' worth of Duloxetine. - - evidence was that it was ""most unusuaf' to prescribe such a large amount of medication (6 months' worth of Duloxetine) during the initial period where a patient's medication had been switched and where close monitoring was needed. He opined that the first 6 weeks of the 'switch' period were ones in which the patien mi ht et better, might get worse and might develop suicidal thoughts. - said that such a volume of medication was not merited clinica y an cou d create a risk of overdose. 5. On 8 and 9 November 2017 the deceased saw Dr B. She made no notes of his presentation or diagnosis on any occasion when she saw him which she accepted she should have done. She ÔøΩt note her rationale for changing his medication which again ..... said should have happened. He also considered that Dr B should have examined the past records for the deceased which she accepted she had not done in full. 6. There are a series of further issues with the medication Dr B prescribed the deceased and her records of the same. The electronic patient notes reflect a prescription for Xanax but she said in evidence that the deceased had not in fact accepted this. She prescribed him Temazepam but this is a controlled drug in this country and cannot be prescribed in the usual way. She changed this to Nitrazepam but the dose was incorrect and this was refused by the pharmacy. The next day she prescribed him Lorazepam without him returning the Nitrazepam prescription to her. She made an error in the dose for Lorazepam and had to correct that. When he attended on 15 November 2017 asking for more medication she made no note of his attendance. 7 ....... evidence was that the multiple changes to the medication ""regiriie""'iie by Dr B were not medically indicated and that the deceased clearly needed an urgent psychiatric referral.

The evidence received at the prevention of future deaths hearing showed that many of those concerns have been addressed. However, in my opinion the following concerns remain and give rise to a continuing risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows : A. Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Concern 1 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff responsible for the triage of referrals to child mental health services had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I have been told that the triaging process is now undertaken by an úAccess and Advice Teamù but I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff in that Team to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 2 The evidence at the inquest revealed that, despite a series of referrals to child mental health services over many years, Oskar Nash never received the clinical assessment he needed. I have been told that the system now in place ought to result in a child such as Oskar being seen and assessed by a clinical team. I am satisfied that the introduction of the Access and Advice Team, in the context of the new Mindworks service, is intended to ensure that a referred childôs needs are properly identified and met. However, on the basis of the evidence I heard at the prevention of future deaths hearing, including from a special needs school which has experience of referring its pupils, I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that some referrals may be inappropriately closed (for example because the child, at an early stage, declines to engage) or inappropriately referred to non-clinical partner agencies. In this context, I am concerned that there is a lack of specific monitoring of what proportion of referred children reach a clinical team and the extent to which the outcomes match the expectations of the referrers (so that any ongoing úbarriersù in the system, which may be preventing proper access to the clinical teams, can then be identified and eliminated). Concern 3 The evidence showed that a referral to the child mental health services is triaged initially as being crisis, urgent, priority or routine. The criteria for crisis, urgent and priority referrals are specific and narrow and, consequently, the great majority of referrals are categorised as routine. I have been told that the routine referrals are automatically categorised as úlow riskù. I am concerned about this as it is clear from the evidence that a child may not meet the criteria crisis, urgent or priority but, like Oskar Nash, may nevertheless be at a high or medium risk of harm. The Trust is currently receiving a high volume of referrals and so there is a considerable waiting time for its úroutineù cases to be addressed. It seems inevitable, therefore, that there are children in this category who have been wrongly assumed to be at low risk of harm but who, in fact, face a high risk of harm which is currently unrecognised and unmanaged. Concern 4 I was told that the Standard Operating Procedure manual for the triage of referrals to childrenôs mental health services is to be updated to reflect the Trustôs new working practices but that this has not yet been done. I am concerned that important changes to the system of work (for example, the vital requirement that a referred childôs records are reviewed before any triaging decision is made and the child/family are spoken to) are not yet established in written guidance. Concern 5 The evidence at the inquest showed that the clinicians who were responsible for ensuring that Oskar Nashôs medical conditions, including his risk of self-harm and suicide, and his consequential needs, were properly and sufficiently recorded in his Education, Health and Care Plan, failed to do so; this was in part because they did not fully understand their role and obligations in this regard. On the basis of the evidence at the prevention of future deaths hearing, I am concerned that there continues to be a lack of understanding amongst the clinicians currently providing medical advice as part of the EHCP process as to their role in that process. I am further concerned that there is in place no programme for the training or monitoring of these clinicians in relation to these responsibilities. B. Surrey County Council (and National) (i) Education and Special Educational Needs Department Concern 6 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in the Education / SEN Department, including SEN caseworkers, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 7 The evidence at the inquest showed that, in the months before his death, Oskar Nash was moved from a special needs school and placed into a mainstream school which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet his complex needs. I found that the inappropriate placement, by SCC, of Oskar into the mainstream school contributed to his death. Prior to the placement, the mainstream school had been provided with Oskarôs Educational, Health and Care Plan, but this failed adequately to identify and record his mental and emotional health concerns, his risk of suicidal ideation, his consequential needs, and the provision required to meet those needs, and it had not been updated to reflect a series of subsequent reviews of the Plan and significant subsequent events. The mainstream school was not provided with any of the extensive and informative records from the special needs school from which he was being moved. I was told by the mainstream school that, had they seen the records held by his special needs school, they would have recognised their inability to meet his needs and informed the SEN Department accordingly. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I was told that it continues to be the case that a prospective school will usually be provided by the SEN Department with the childôs EHCP only. Further, it was apparent that there is a lack of clarity as to the extent to which a current school may or should provide records or information to a prospective school. I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that placements of children with EHCPs are being made on the basis of inadequate information and record sharing. On the evidence before me, it was clear that, even if an EHCP were comprehensive and fully updated (which may not be the case), it is unlikely to contain all matters of relevance to the question of a prospective schoolôs ability to meet the childôs needs. I was given no good reason why fuller information and record sharing, sufficient to ensure that the prospective school can properly assess its ability to meet the childôs needs, should not take place before any child with an EHCP is placed in a new school. I am concerned that there is no system in place, locally or nationally, to ensure this is achieved by the relevant SEN department for every child with an EHCP. I am also concerned that there is an ongoing lack of clarity as to schoolsô powers and duties to share information and documents, and any data protection ramifications this may have. (ii) Childrenôs Services Department Concern 8 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in SCCôs Childrenôs Services Department, including Social Workers and other Team members, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self- harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 9 At the inquest I found that following Oskar Nashôs final referral to SCCôs Childrenôs Services Department, which was made approximately two months before his death, there was a failure to appreciate the seriousness of his situation and the risks arising, and a consequential failure to allocate his case appropriately. I found that this contributed to his death. The inappropriate allocation resulted, in part, from the application of SCCôs then úthreshold of needsù document, which was used to inform the level at which support should be provided. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence about SCCôs revised úthreshold of needsù document, as well as the recent guidance (including a útoolboxù) in relation to suicidality, which has been introduced since Oskarôs death. Despite these changes, I remain concerned that the úthreshold of needsù document does not adequately and clearly reflect the known risks of mental health difficulties, self-harm, and suicidal ideation for autistic children (given their prevalence in this group of children) and that, consequentially, there is an ongoing risk that an autistic child in these circumstances will be allocated an insufficient level of support, as was the case for Oskar. C. Surrey County Council and Surrey Heartlands Clinical Commissioning Group (and National) Concern 10 At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence concerning the post- death reviews conducted into Oskar Nashôs death by the Surrey Child Death Review Partnership Team and the Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership. The evidence showed that neither process resulted in a sufficient or effective investigation of the death; I consider that the evidence shows that fact finding was superficial, there was no meaningful analysis of the part played by statutory agencies in the causation of his death, and only very limited learning was identified. Ineffective review by the child death review processes results in the risk of further deaths in similar circumstances and I am concerned that the local and/or national process, guidance and oversight are insufficient to ensure that an effective post- death investigation, which should not be dependent on the inquest process, is achieved in all cases. D. National Issues Concern 11 From the evidence I heard at the inquest and the prevention of future deaths hearing, it was apparent that the national úWorking Togetherù guidance focuses on children who are in need of safeguarding by reason of risks within the home or from other parental failures to keep the child safe. It was apparent that the consequential approach tends to look critically at the childôs family and parent(s) and their parenting skills, and that this is likely to be inappropriate if the child is in need through disability. I consider that this had a detrimental impact on the approach of agencies to Oskar and his family. I am concerned that úWorking Togetherù does not provide clearer guidance specifically for the safeguarding of children with disabilities, including Autism, and the approach to be taken by agencies to parents and families. Concern 12 The evidence at the inquest revealed a widespread lack of knowledge and understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self- harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. There was a lack of training across all the state agencies from which I heard. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence of more training being available, but also of an ongoing absence of comprehensive, relevant and mandatory training. I was told that the National Autism Strategy does not currently include a timetabled commitment for relevant mandatory Autism training to be provided to all state agencies working directly with autistic adults and children. I am concerned that this poses an ongoing risk to autistic children and their ability to access the services they require for their support, welfare, and safeguarding."

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì During the inquest it became apparent that a certain number of prisoners in HMP Wormwood Scrubs were detained for deportation reasons after the conclusion of their prison sentence. There seemed to be a marked disparity between the information and advice available to a detained prisoner, compared with a free individual or one in a deportation centre. There was a paucity of available information and the letters sent out by the Home Office were written in legal English with no offer of translation or úplain Englishù assistance. Individuals in the community could access the internet, Law centres, citizens advice or any other sources of assistance that were not available to detained prisoners due to the restrictive regime, putting them at a disadvantage. Communication between the prison officers and home office officials and immigration staff was ineffective and frequently not evidenced at all. Pieces of paper were lost, phones were unanswered with no answer phone facility, email addresses were unavailable due to incompatible systems and there was no audit trail of attempted communications or the reason why these were unsuccessful. Many requests made by or on behalf of the prisoner were not dealt with in a timely manner or at all. 3"

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The option for applicants to disclose a mental health illness should be considered separate to them confirming whether they have any disabilityô or special needsô. It is likely that the majority of applicants will consider evidence of a disability or special needs to refer to physical illness, not mental health illness. Moreover, those who suffer from mental health illness (irrespective of its severity) will often not consider themselves to have a disabilityô. Omitting to refer specifically (and explicitly) to mental health on the form could, in my judgement, discourage applicants from disclosing information about their mental health diagnosis, and thus provide them with support at the point they commence their studies."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13th January 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide 3 1b 1c II CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH 4 On 14th August 2021 Mr Darren Busby was at home with his family. He and ended his life. Prior to his death Mr Busby had complained of headaches and had been referred for an MRI scan of his head. He had had the MRI scan in 5 April 2021. It emerged in the course of my investigation that the outcome of that MRI scan was never reviewed by a clinician. I did not conclude that this was causative of, or related to, Mr Busby's death. However, the circumstances in which it was not reviewed give me cause for concern that there is a risk of future deaths unless action is taken. CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - After it became apparent that the result of Mr Busby's MRI scan had not been reviewed by a clinician, a consultant employed by North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust ('the Trust') undertook an investigation. He noted that the Trust use EMIS as an electronic patient record. He explained that the Trust used a separate system called ICE to gather the results of tests or scans. ICE is capable of linking to EMIS to input results into the EMIS system. Once a test result has been linked to a patient in EMIS the result enters the EMIS record as a provisional result pending review, and is placed on a work list. The consultant or a deputy then reviews the result, files it with or without comment and records any actions taken. EMIS provides two options: 'file no comment' and 'file and comment'. Results of blood tests which are undertaken to monitor treatment and which are normal may be filed without comment. If there is an abnormality flagged, however, EMIS will default to the file with comment dialogue box even if file no comment is selected. This acts as a safeguard against missing a significant finding. Unfortunately, there is no flag attached in the ICE system for abnormal radiology results, and so no failsafe exists for defaulting to a 'file and comment' if a significant positive or negative finding is reported. In the course of investigating what occurred in relation to Mr Busby's MRI scan, it was determined that clicking more than once on the 'file no comment' button will result in the displayed result being filed, but will also result in filing of the next in the list if that result has no flag indicating the result is abnormal. Thus if a radiology result lies below a normal blood result and a clinician inadvertently double clicks to file the first result, the radiology result is also filed without comment and without the result being displayed. Furthermore, multiple clicks up to 6 (and perhaps even beyond) will lead to multiple filings. In the result it is possible that a clinician inadvertently clicking 'file no comment' more than once on one result would cause results which require urgent follow up being filed without a clinician being involved. I am concerned that this might lead to lost opportunities to treat patients whose scans reveal, for instance, early malignancies. It might also mean that scans which reveal the need for urgent action will be overlooked. I am therefore concerned that future deaths will occur. I was impressed by the candour of the report provided to me and the efforts that the Trust have already taken to resolve this issue. However I noted that the evidence I received was that ""In order to fix this issue it is likely it will require action by the publishers of EMIS to prevent accidental filing of results. To attempt to mitigate this issue whilst a permanent fix is sought I have worked with colleagues from Pathology and Radiology to attempt to have all radiology results (where the greatest risk lies) flagged within the ICE system as abnormal, so that any attempt to file the result prompts via the file and comment dialogue box. Unfortunately at the time of writing this letter the flag, which is triggered in ICE for any radiology report originating within Cumbria Neuroscience, does not carry through to EMIS 9 and we continue to seek a local solution to mitigate this newly identified risk."" In the circumstances I have concluded that it is necessary for action to be taken to prevent future deaths. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN 6 In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (1) North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust and (2) EMIS Group have the power to take such action.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - After it became apparent that the result of Mr Busby's MRI scan had not been reviewed by a clinician, a consultant employed by North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust ('the Trust') undertook an investigation. He noted that the Trust use EMIS as an electronic patient record. He explained that the Trust used a separate system called ICE to gather the results of tests or scans. ICE is capable of linking to EMIS to input results into the EMIS system. Once a test result has been linked to a patient in EMIS the result enters the EMIS record as a provisional result pending review, and is placed on a work list. The consultant or a deputy then reviews the result, files it with or without comment and records any actions taken. EMIS provides two options: 'file no comment' and 'file and comment'. Results of blood tests which are undertaken to monitor treatment and which are normal may be filed without comment. If there is an abnormality flagged, however, EMIS will default to the file with comment dialogue box even if file no comment is selected. This acts as a safeguard against missing a significant finding. Unfortunately, there is no flag attached in the ICE system for abnormal radiology results, and so no failsafe exists for defaulting to a 'file and comment' if a significant positive or negative finding is reported. In the course of investigating what occurred in relation to Mr Busby's MRI scan, it was determined that clicking more than once on the 'file no comment' button will result in the displayed result being filed, but will also result in filing of the next in the list if that result has no flag indicating the result is abnormal. Thus if a radiology result lies below a normal blood result and a clinician inadvertently double clicks to file the first result, the radiology result is also filed without comment and without the result being displayed. Furthermore, multiple clicks up to 6 (and perhaps even beyond) will lead to multiple filings. In the result it is possible that a clinician inadvertently clicking 'file no comment' more than once on one result would cause results which require urgent follow up being filed without a clinician being involved. I am concerned that this might lead to lost opportunities to treat patients whose scans reveal, for instance, early malignancies. It might also mean that scans which reveal the need for urgent action will be overlooked. I am therefore concerned that future deaths will occur. I was impressed by the candour of the report provided to me and the efforts that the Trust have already taken to resolve this issue. However I noted that the evidence I received was that ""In order to fix this issue it is likely it will require action by the publishers of EMIS to prevent accidental filing of results. To attempt to mitigate this issue whilst a permanent fix is sought I have worked with colleagues from Pathology and Radiology to attempt to have all radiology results (where the greatest risk lies) flagged within the ICE system as abnormal, so that any attempt to file the result prompts via the file and comment dialogue box. Unfortunately at the time of writing this letter the flag, which is triggered in ICE for any radiology report originating within Cumbria Neuroscience, does not carry through to EMIS 9 and we continue to seek a local solution to mitigate this newly identified risk."" In the circumstances I have concluded that it is necessary for action to be taken to prevent future deaths.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: - 1. ÔøΩ The management of medication prescribed to prisoners. At post mortem examination the toxicologist determined that there were a number of drugs in Ian's blood and urine that he had not been prescribed. The court was informed that at HMP Usk, all prisoners are required to be capable of managing their own medication. The medications are not kept in a locked facility. The evidence provided clearly indicated that prisoners were trading prescribed medication which had become a form of currency within the prison. Ian's former cellmate indicated this practice was rife and indeed Ian bought medication from other prisoners. Evidence was heard from the Governor / Head of Safety at HMP Usk who informed the court that he was not aware of this practice, and it appears this was also not known by the prison officers. The court was informed that there is a system of randomised checks in place within the prison to attempt to determine whether prisoners are appropriately managing their medication, however prisoners have clearly found ways around this. Whilst the ingestion of unprescribed medication did not contribute to Ian's death, this practice, if left unchecked, clearly puts the lives of other prisoners at risk in the future."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì From the evidence I heard, the Care Coordinatorôs role is to assess the patientôs care needs and to plan and review those needs across the broad spectrum of physical and mental health and social needs within the multi-disciplinary team within the Mental Health Trust. The Care Coordinator is the individual who has the closest contact with the patient and, as the title suggests, is the liaison link for every other professional and agency. From the evidence, it is clear that an enormous burden of responsibility and reliance is placed on the individual Care Coordinator as they are expected to be the conduit of information to other professionals and to continuously review and assess all areas of the patientôs needs and to call in others as required. I concluded that the only person who had the ability to have a comprehensive view of Ms Flintôs mental health was the Care Coordinator and the quality of the information provided to others within the multi-disciplinary team and other agencies was entirely dependent on the ability, availability, resources, experience, training and skills of the Care Coordinator. (1) From the evidence, it appeared that the precise job description and requirements of Care coordinators differs between local Trusts so that there is no consistency as to the way in which individual Care coordinators are expected to fulfil their role. (2) It also emerged that the resources available to the Community Mental Health Teams are limited so that in the absence of a Care Coordinator during periods of annual leave or sickness, there was no other Care Coordinator who could fulfil the role."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - This report relates to two inquests. They were held jointly after I acceded to a request from the bereaved family that the inquests be conducted together. As will have been noted from section 4 above, both Marshall Metcalfe and his Mother, Jane Ireland, were known to mental health services. The concern I wish to raise emanated from Marshall's death. He had been admitted to a mental health facility in February 2019 and remained there until he was discharged on 06/01/20 to his Mother's home where he resided until his death on 07/05/20. One month later, his Mother Jane died at her home on 07/06/2020. was discharged on 06/01/20 and he returned to reside with his Mother. This was a decision early made withthe support of Marshall and his Mother. By the time he was discharged minimal progress had been made and his lack of engagement persisted. An alternative placement was not considered, largely because of his desire to return home and to 2 supportive family. Childrenôs social care were unable to contribute to discharge planning having not been notified about Marshall's discharge or approximately two months afterwards. No sk assessment had been completed. Following discharge, Marshall continued to take his prescribed Clozapine medication. Over subsequent weeks his presentation remained stable although his weight did noticeably increase which isa known side effect ofthat medication. Following discharge, he was not seen by a community psychiatrist at a planned review on 19/03/20 asa result of coronavirus restrictions in place at that time. At around 12 noon on 07/05/20 he was seen to eave hore, Marshall was transferred by ambulance tothe Royal Preston Hospital but had received catastrophic Injuries and his death was verified at 14:33 hours that afternoon. In box 3 ofthe Record of Inquest for Jane, | recorded a follows: Jane ireland was known to have had a history of mental health issues, although in recent years she had been largely stable, and save for a relapse in early 2018 when she had stopped {aking her medication and in December 2019 when she went to see her own GP and was referred to START, she experienced no major relapses or acute episodes. On 7th May 2020, Jane's seventeen year old Son died. Having been seen at her home address on 6"" June 2020 when she is reported to have been in good spirits, Jane was found deceased in her bed by 3 friend at her home address on 07/06/2020. A paramedic attended and verified her death at 16:00 hours. A subsequent post mortem examination revealed that Jane had, during the hours prior to her death, the tone effects of which, in combination with faty liver disease, proved fatal. Her death was more than minimally contributed to by bronchopneumonia Identified at post mortem. From the available evidence it cannot be established whether Jane intended to end her ite. CORONER'S"

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. The evidence revealed prison officers are not obtaining, nor did the prison systems require them to obtain, a response from all prisoners during welfare checks. More specifically, during the morning unlock they are not required to, and therefore do not necessarily seek to, obtain a response or otherwise engage with prisoners. In particular, no response is required, and therefore not sought, from prisoners who appear to be asleep in bed, notwithstanding the requirements of PSI 75/2011 (Residential Services). The PSI sets out the fact that residential prison staff play a key role in spotting any signs of distress and will often be the first to pick up information or signs, and should accordingly engage with prisoners in such a way that facilitates the identification of any concerns or distress. Further, paragraph 2.3 of the PSI, namely, úOutput No. 3 Prisoners are supported and their daily needs are metù states that prisons are required to have, úclearly understood systems in place for staff to assure themselves of the wellbeing of prisoners during or shortly after unlockù. In the absence of such systems prisoners in distress, or otherwise a cause for concern, may be missed."

I am aware that work has begun on this, but in my view, consideration should be given to doing this more quickly, and certainly within a realistic but clear timeframe. 2. Consideration should be given to identifying key risk factors, and how (in very practical terms) that information can be used to reduce suicide risk. 3. Consideration should be given to regular review of individual soldiers, to screen their mental as well as physical health. It may be that that would be something which would sit better outside of their chain of command. 4. Consideration should be given to increasing awareness of how to handle service complaints within the army. Service complaints are made when, by definition, things are not going well, and this could be viewed as a risk factor."

Mared had failed one Professional Skills Assessment during the second year of her degree (2019/2020) and had undertaken a resit during the first semester for which she had received a provisional passô. This was not ratified in the June exam board; instead it was to be ratified in the September exam board round in accordance with the Universityôs policy (though that was not obviously clear at the time). The indication therefore to Mared in July 2020 was that she had not successfully completed the year. The result was later ratified in September. Furthermore, marks of 39% and 1% (fails) for assessments are given in situations where marks could be pendingô. (2) There is no system in place for personal tutors to contact students ahead of the release of failed examination results, especially in vulnerable students. Students are not contacted directly by telephone by their personal tutors ahead of the release of the results in the event of failed modules or in the event of being informed that they had not successfully completed the year despite the complex and confusing assessment and results process and potentially misleading process around the sharing of examination results. ae Katie Sutherland Acting Senior Coroner Senior Coroner for North West Wales REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO: President and Vice-Chancellor, Cardiff Univer CORONER 1am Kate Sutherland Acting Senior Coroner for North West Wales CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS: | make tis report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 ofthe Coraners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST (0n 14/07/2020 | commenced an investigation into the death of Mared Thomas Foukes, 21 .

There was no psychologist on the ward to contribute to care planning. The nursing records were incomplete, possibly due to teething problems associated with the recently introduced electronic recording system. 3. When the section was rescinded, Mr Bastock became a voluntary patient on the ward. In the three days following 17 September 2020, various factors should have triggered a need to reconsider the decision, including: a) Mr Bastock left the ward on occasions and once did not return until 5am. b) On his return, there was no recorded evaluation of his situation and what action was required from the team treating him. c) A family member voiced concern that he was unwell and was not ready to be discharged, yet this warning was not heeded. d) Another family member reported that he had gone to his former partner (whom he had not seen for several years) to give her £250 he had withdrawn from a cash machine for his children. The possibility that this act amounted to a farewell gesture was noted in the nursing record, but its significance was not sufficiently considered. e) Mr Bastock had indicated he felt unable to live alone. Although a social work assessment had taken place, no plan in relation to alternative accommodation had materialised. In the absence of such transition infrastructure, it was premature to consider him for discharge from the section. f) When Mr Bastock left the ward, there was a failure to notify the police of him as a missing person, given his suicide risk (irrespective of whether this complied with the prevailing missing person's policy stipulated timescales)."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì During the inquest evidence was heard about the differences in the way CAMHS Hospitals and Adult mental Health Hospitals approached the care of the patients on their wards. When hearing evidence during the inquest it was established that when a child turned 18, and was a patient on a Mental health ward, once transferred to an adult Mental Health Hospital they would immediately be treated in accordance with the adult provisions. It was accepted that there is no provision there is currently no one in-patient provision for people between the ages of 14-25.

The medical cause of death was: 1a) 1b) 1c) 2 The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide. 4. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mary Bush had a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress syndrome and suicidal ideation. She was referred to the mental health team in November 2019 and was assessed in January 2020. Mary Bush was awaiting referral for psychological therapy at the time of her death. On 6 August 2020 Mary was found to her home. Evidence was heard that Mary had intended to take her own life by her actions 5. CORONERôS CONCERNS During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. I was satisfied after hearing evidence that action has been taken to address many of those concerns. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The outstanding matters of concern are as follows: 1. Mary was referred to the mental health team in November 2019 and was assessed in January 2020, some three weeks later than should have been. 2. There was a delay in Mary receiving psychological therapy. She was still on the waiting list at the time of her death. 3. The evidence was that at the date of inquest, there continued to be a delay in service users receiving psychological therapy. Evidence was heard that balancing capacity and demand, which has increased, remains a challenge. The cases referred are of increasing complexity, as in Maryôs case 4. Some steps have been taken in an effort to deal with this, such as specific risk assessment training, focusing on intervention treatment plans to aid capacity and throughput, reviewing the skill mix of staff 5. However, there is the ongoing issue of recruitment and retention of suitably skilled staff by the Trust and the ability to resource this to enable the Trust to function effectively 6.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. 4 a.The transfer and communication process from the HBTT to the CMHT in 2019 and 2020 was unsatisfactory with inadequate follow up as required. The court has received evidence about similar problems in other inquests in which GMMH was the treating NHS Trust and is a repeated issue of concern. b. There was lack of appropriate escalation following the deceasedôs disengagement with community services in 2019 but also in 2020 when there was a repeated lack of direct contact with him as well as the recognition of its importance. From June 2020 no other methods were tried to have direct contact with the deceased apart from attempts from phone calls which were repeatedly unsuccessful. c. There was no consideration of referral back to the HBTT by the CMHT when the deceased may have benefited from it when circumstances changed. There was disengagement from services after the end of February 2020 as well as evidence of noncompliance with medication. d. There was no GMMH procedure or process to check regularly if the deceased was being prescribed the correct medication and it being collected. In addition his response to it. e. The GP practice failed to ensure that medication (for a patient with a serious mental health problem with a history of suicidal ideas, plans and previous attempts) was prescribed. This is despite them receiving letters from GMMH clinicians requesting this. Consequently, the deceased did not receive the therapeutic benefit the medication would have provided. f. The GP system for recording receipt of correspondence and ensuring that they were seen and reviewed by a GP was inadequate. As was communication with and from the Pharmacy team. Nor was there consideration of a system or process for contacting the secondary care provider GMMH in such circumstances when medication was not prescribed as requested and no contact could be made with the deceased. There was no escalation process/procedure. g. There was no CMHT/HBTT planned involvement with the GP in the overall management and treatment of the deceased apart from simply requesting that they issue repeat prescriptions. This meant that opportunities to develop other lines of communication and information sharing as well as support were lost. h. The CMHT Responsible Clinician was an important witness but the GMMH SUI investigation did not obtain a statement from him and the those carrying out the investigation failed to recognise the significance of this. Nor was this identified in the overview of the report before it was signed off. This meant the all the lessons for future care and planning were not learnt. The court has received evidence about the same issue in other inquests involving deaths of GMMH patients and is a repeated matter of concern"
https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/alexandra-tolley-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2021-0344,10/14/2021,Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,"During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì Evidence taken at the Inquest indicated Ms Tolley had been admitted to the Becklin Centre late on the night of 18 October 2019 and was Sectioned on 24 October. She was categorised as at high riskô and deemed to require 1:1 continuous observations, within eyesight, without bathroom privacy. In the days preceding her death 7 incidents occurred, culminating in one around 13.00 hours on Sunday 27 October. At approximately 13.50 hours the same afternoon she absconded whilst being permitted to walk in the hospital grounds with an escort. Approximately one hour later she was found with a that resulted in un-survivable injuries and died the following day. 2 1. The Care Plan agreed between Ms Tolley and the team treating her, included a provision that in the event she absconded, she would neither be restrained, nor followed. Given her history and risk profile, it appeared this contingent instruction to staff regarding the risk of absconding, placed too much emphasis on her long term ability to manage her own turbulent emotions, at the expense of the imperative of keeping her safe. The priorities underlying such instructions merit further review. 2. The absconding instructions to staff (set out above) seems incompatible with the duty to detain in order to keep safe, inherent in an order under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 when viewed in the context of a patient deemed to require such intensive monitoring. 3. The decision to permit ground leave so shortly after a incident (and only three days after a previous absconding incident) was made on a relatively informal basis. There were no documented criteria to be considered before it was approved, nor was the grade of staff required to make the decision stipulated. 4. The instruction to staff stipulated physical interventionsô will not be used to restrain Ms Tolley, yet this expression was not defined or particularised. Greater clarity might assist a staff escort (likely to be a relatively junior individual) to know whether it was permissible, for example, to put a gentle hand on Ms Tolleyôs shoulder to steer her back towards the hospital. 5. The permission given to walk in the grounds of the hospital was not considered to amount to section 17 MHA 1983 leave. The informality involved in the decision missed an opportunity to consider issues such as: (a) Whether two escorts would be appropriate in view of Ms Tolley having absconded three days earlier. This would have facilitated one person following her to monitor and report on her whereabouts. In a time critical situation this could have altered the tragic outcome; (b) Providing the escort with a discretion in the manner of a dynamic risk assessment whether or not to follow Ms Tolley. (c) Reviewing the type of applied to her wounds, before she was permitted to leave the ward, in the light of her misuse of these . 6. The care plan containing the staff instruction not to restrain or follow was discussed and agreed with Ms Tolley. She was thus expressly aware that if she did decide to abscond, she knew she would be able to do so. Moreover, she was explicitly told that the staff member escorting her would return to the reception area and wait for a short period in the hope Ms Tolley would return voluntarily. The implication of this was that Ms Tolley knew she had a period of grace of around 10 minutes in which to get clear of the hospital, before the police would be asked to search for her. Whilst potentially beneficial from a therapeutic perspective, such knowledge may also inform a vulnerable patient on ways in which the protection afforded by a MHA Section could be undermined. The wisdom of explaining to a patient how the hospital staff would respond to them absconding should be reviewed. 7. Ms Tolley was found with a made from used some time earlier to dress a self-inflicted wound. She had twice before used such as : (1) earlier the same day and (2) three days previously- 24 October. Consideration should be given to the types of used at the Becklin Centre, with a view to selecting a type which could not serve as a . 8. The Inquest was informed that the general policy in relation to absconding patients has been under review since Ms Tolleyôs death nearly two years ago but has (understandably) been delayed during the Covid pandemic. It was said a draft revised policy was sent to West Yorkshire Police on 14 June 2021 by way of consultation, but no response has been received. In the meantime, similar instructions are still being issued to staff not to restrain or follow in some other cases. There is thus an ongoing risk of further deaths should a comparable situation arise again. 3"

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì i) Insufficiency of note-keeping. ii) The note made by Dr in the RiO records was described by an independent expert, Dr , as extremely brief. I accept that medical notes should not be defensive in nature but there is nothing at all in it to justify the view expressed that Kirsty was safe to 2 Information Classification: CONTROLLED go home. In a context where she has, over a very recent period, attempted to on five occasions, the rationale explaining how it was felt she was safe to go home should, in my view, have been set out. Of perhaps more significance is that there was nothing in the note to assist clinicians with understanding how the future care plan was to be organised. That was in a context where a national lockdown was imminent. Given the unprecedented circumstances, it seems apparent to me that there was all the more reason to provide detail in this regard. The fact it was not set out, it seems to me, implies that there was doubt on the part of Dr about how the plan to continue treating Kirsty was to be organised. My fear is that this simply passed the burden of the management of the risk to . This reached an entirely foreseeable crisis in the early hours of 23 March. Kirsty had deteriorated to the point she was described as very suicidal. was exhausted from his desperate efforts to keep his wife safe. He rang the ward for assistance. There was no one available to help him. was advised to call the emergency services. He rang the police who told him to ring the ambulance service who told him to ring the CMHT in the morning. This should not have happened. A detailed plan with how to manage an acute deterioration could have prevented it. At the time, Doctor was effectively carrying the burden of two consultant psychiatrists in that Dr was away from work. I indicated at inquest that if this was due to under-resourcing of the Trust, I would write to those responsible for funding. I was advised that, in fact, the problem may be due to a scarcity of consultant psychiatrists nationally. I would be grateful if you could please let me know the position. iii) Lack of involvement of family/carer in discharge process The Trustôs own discharge policy states: 3. Principles The decision to discharge someone from hospital must be in keeping with the Care Programme Approach (CPA), (DH 1991, 2008) and governed by the following principles: The patient, carer and / or advocate, must be actively involved in all aspects of the discharge plan, where practicable. Arrangements for discharge should be negotiated with everyone likely to be concerned with the service userôs aftercare. was Kirstyôs carer. He had not been actively involved in all aspects of the discharge plan.ô He had a phone call to come and collect her and on arriving at the hospital he found her bag to be packed. He did not feel as though he was given any choice. I acknowledged at inquest that there were extenuating circumstances in that Kirsty's discharge coincided with the first national lockdown during the COVID pandemic. Nevertheless, I think it is appropriate to bring to your attention whether there is a need to remind clinicians to involve families and carers in a meaningful way during the discharge process."

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) The transfer and review of prisoners on an ACCT. I am concerned in relation to the ability of any Prison to close an ACCT, with the attendance of 2 individuals (a prison and health care staff), after a short period of time on a newly transferred inmate (i.e. to a new prison) before anyone has had the time to review and assess him or her. For ACCTs created on current inmates within an establishment, who are known to staff, I do not see that as an issue, they would already have an existing knowledge and relationship and indeed would have been the originator of the ACCT in any event. However, for new prisoners, who have arrived from another prison establishment with an open ACCT on their record, I consider the ability to remove that individual from the ACCT, within a short period of time, does raise issues in respect of the knowledge and understanding of that individual and the ability of various agencies, within the prison, to have had time to review and communicate between themselves, about that individual. The provision of in effect 2 noô answers by a prisoner, is a potentially easy way of coming off an ACCT, which is there for their support and well-being, and I would suggest, given to easy manipulation I raise the issue as to whether there should be, for example, a set review period (e.g. 7 days) which allows time for the support services to meet with and interview the transferred inmate, interact, and then make a decision about and with the newly transferred prisoner on the ACCT before such an ACCT is closed."

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì During the course of the inquest evidence was heard from a number of witnesses of the supervision and staffing arrangements within SACU.

On the 2nd September 2019 the document setting out which hourly checks had been undertaken in the SACU was incomplete. No check on Mr Toddôs cell took place at 3pm that day. Evidence was heard that staffing levels can vary, with officers being occupied on tasks which meant hourly checks could not always be completed.

Practice Manager at The Medical Centre, Cardiff Road, Taff's Well, CF15 7YG","During the course of the inquest, evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: - 1. Response to Mental Health Concerns by Reception Staff During the course of the inquest, Mr Martin Smith, Siwan's husband, raised concerns that on 18th November 2020, Siwan telephoned the Medical Centre to obtain an urgent appointment with a doctor. She was informed by the receptionist that the earliest appointment was on 30th November 2020. The Medical Centre provided me with a report which indicated that when Siwan asked about whether there were any emergency appointments for mental health problems she was advised that these are not routinely offered unless a patient is having ""bad thoughts"". Your report states that an emergency appointment was not requested and at no point was it suggested the call was a mental health emergency. The Medical Centre provided me with a recording of the telephone exchange between Siwan and the receptionist. I found during the inquest that Siwan asked repeatedly if she could have an earlier appointment and was clearly upset that she could not. She was not asked if she was having bad thoughts or whether she required urgent mental health support. It was clear towards the end of the conversation that Siwan was distressed. I also received in evidence a letter dated 8 March 2021 written By , the Practice Manager to Mr Smith, in which she implies that the receptionists are not clinically trained to make assessments. I accept this, however in the circumstances I determined that Siwan should have received a call back from someone who was clinically trained to ascertain whether she required an urgent mental health assessment. In the circumstances I did not find that a different course of action would have prevented Siwan's death or would have altered the outcome. However I am concerned that lives could be put at risk in the future if there continues to be a lack of awareness of when a patient may require a clinical assessment in relation to their mental health."

CORONER I am Scott Matthewson, Assistant Coroner for the coroner area of Mid Kent & Medway. 2. CORONERôS LEGAL POWERS I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29. 3. INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 1 May 2018 the Area Coroner for Mid Kent & Medway commenced an investigation into the death of Lee Ryan Thrumble who died, aged 26, on 18 April 2018 at the Medway Maritime Hospital, Windmill Road, Gillingham, Kent ME7 5NY. Mid Kent and Medway Coroners Cantium House REGULATION 28 REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS Lee Ryan THRUMBLE (died 18 April 2018)","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Evidence was given by a Prison Service Governor and HMP Rochester, the Head of Healthcare at HMP Rochester and (by letter) Prison-NOMIS Application Support And Change Manager that: (1) Critical information relating to prisoners contained on his Prison National Offender Management Information System (úNOMISù). (2) Prison Service staff and clinical staff working with prisoners are permitted to (and need) access NOMIS in order to keep prisoners safe. (3) Use of NOMIS is restricted to those who have been trained to use it (via a short online course known as the Getting Startedô module). Once the online training has been completed the person is issued with a certificate. That certificate is then provided to the MOJ Business Application Support Team / Justice Digital & Technology. That department then issues the person a NOMIS username and password. The turnaround time is usually two days. (4) Whilst all prison staff were trained in the use of this system and were able to access it, only some clinical staff are able to access NOMIS. (5) The reason that all Prison Service Staff were able to access NOMIS was because training in the use of NOMIS is a compulsory part of their training. (6) The reason that only some clinical staff could access NOMIS was because it is voluntary (although encouraged and supported by the MOJ). (7) If NOMIS training was a compulsory part of training for all clinicians working with prisoners: a. It is likely that most (if not all) nurses would be able to access NOMIS within a relatively short period of time. b. Prisoners would, as a result, be safer. c. The Business Application Support Team / Justice Digital & Technology at the MOJ would welcome and support such training (see attached letter from from that team dated 3 September 2021). I am concerned that: (a) Lee died partly because of a lack of training which prevented staff from accessing and reviewing information. (b) NOMIS contains important information that can be of use to clinical staff when looking after prisoners. (c) Not all nurses can access NOMIS because it is not a compulsory part of their training. (d) The NOMIS training is already available, can be completed online and access to NOMIS can be gained within two days. (e) If the current situation continues there is a risk that prisoners may die as a result. This situation should be reviewed and consideration given to whether NOMIS training should be made compulsory for clinicians working within prisons in England and Wales. 6. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 November 2021. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

It is a major concern that the various systems used throughout the NHS are not compatible with each other and it is not always possible for each healthcare provider to access the notes and records of the patient. This situation should be reviewed to see how access across the NHS can be gained to patient records when required. I was told by one senior clinician that when a patient is referred to his specialist mental health unit it is often the case, that is 9 times out of 10, he does not receive all the information of the patientís history. This would not be the case if he had direct access to the records."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì The inquest heard evidence that Mrs Pimlott had been struggling with her mental health in the weeks preceding her death and had contacted her GP on a number of occasions with anxiety and depression. She was prescribed medication but expressed concerns about the impact of the medication. Telephone consultations rather than face to face 1 appointments continued to be used with her due to the pandemic. Pre Covid it was accepted she would have been seen face to face which would have allowed a more comprehensive assessment of her mental health and her reluctance to use medication. Her GP practice did not refer her to the crisis team, and it was unclear what guidance the practice had for their GPs about when they should refer directly to the crisis team."

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 4 October 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Todd James Salter. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was: Suicide 1 a Suspension by ligature 4. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Mr Salter was released from prison on licence in July 2019. Upon his release there was confusion regarding which organisation had responsibility to assist him with housing leading to him residing with his family. This had a deleterious effect on Mr Salter's mental health as independent living was a key element of him being able to re-establish contact with his daughters. As time progressed Mr Salter's struggles with life increased, the spice habit he had in prison combined with life challenges led to him taking illicit drugs. Although Mr Salter wished to overcome his drug habit he and his family struggled to obtain support needed from the various agencies. Of note was that the Probation officer who had been assigned to Mr Salter stated in evidence that she did not know that an option available to her was to contact ASPIRE Drug and Alcohol Service for Doncaster. She further stated in evidence that she did not know that they could have referred Mr Salter for an assessment, could have sought advice from a Consultant psychiatrist and could have liaised with mental health services together with Mr Salter's mother. These were all crucial elements in providing Mr Salter with the support he clearly needed. As it was, the Probation officer was exploring options to have Mr Salter recalled but communication with Mr Salter as to her intentions in this regard were far from clear. By the 30th September 2019 he was at crisis point, left his mother's address, made his way to Doncaster police station where at some time between 02:41 a.m. and 07:15 a.m. on the 1st October 2019 Mr Salter hanged himself outside the police station.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - (1) The lack of knowledge of the Probation officer as to the services she could contact to obtain necessary mental health assessments. This would appear at the very least to suggest this gap in knowledge may be due to inadequate training. (2) Mr Salter being driven to desperate measures of committing criminal acts in an effort to be arrested or recalled in order to secure treatment and support; this appeared to be the way matters were moving forward without engaging with appropriate mental health services.

He had spoken about taking himself down to the railway line on other occasions as he used to work near there. Steven, due to his anxiety and with COVID restrictions was unable to engage but he struggled engaging with people before these restrictions. During the inquest, there were clear signs that Steven needed more in depth help as did his family, but due to him not engaging, which was a major part of his symptoms he was never given the pathway or help he needed and there were no systems in place for this to happen.

The conclusion of the inquest was 'suicide while suffering anxiety and depression' with the cause of Ms Dunn's death being 'mixed drug toxicity'. 3. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Amanda Dunn died at home on 21 March 2021 from a massive self-administered overdose of prescribed medication. She had a history of mental illness and also had caring responsibilities but a major reason for her fatal actions was an ongoing problem with neighbours. 4.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 5. The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows: Family members told me that for a period of about two years prior to her death Amanda had received a lot of aggravation from a set of neighbours. Police were contacted several times but took no action. The evidence I heard clearly seemed to amount to harassment. Prior to the inquest I was not aware of the full extent of the concerns and had not requested evidence from the police on this (PC gave evidence about the circumstances of the death itself). I realise therefore that I have only heard one side of the story but there is a real concern that police are seeking to brush such incidents under the carpet and not taking them sufficiently seriously.

Chair Catholic Standards Safeguarding Agency 39 Eccleston Square London SW1V 1BX,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. The safeguarding team of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster did not exercise sufficient professional scrutiny of the allegations that came to them from the Anglican safeguarding team. This was partly because they gained a false sense of security from the fact that the allegations came from the Church of England. However, there was more that could have been done to establish the exact nature of the allegations and whether these were credible. The Catholic safeguarding team asked for disclosure from the Anglican safeguarding team and most particularly for the source of the allegations. When they did not receive either of these, they should have insisted. 2. The Catholic safeguarding team met with Father Griffin on 23 June 2020 to discuss his DBS check. That would have been an ideal opportunity to discuss the Church of England allegations that would have shortened the process considerably and the opportunity was lost. 3 3. Father Griffin then asked to know the allegations against him before he attended another meeting with the Catholic safeguarding team. The safeguarding team felt that the information was not theirs to give because it came from the Church of England, but Father Griffin should have been provided with a note of the allegations promptly. 4. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster was unaware of Father Griffinôs attempted suicide nine years earlier. However, it could still have been more proactive than it was in ensuring that he had maximum pastoral support. 5. The Catholic safeguarding team volunteered at inquest that they did not deal with the investigation into Father Griffin promptly and they apologised for this. The very first telephone call was placed to the Catholic safeguarding adviser on 30 October 2019. The delay was therefore significant and it was harmful. This was in part because the Catholic safeguarding team were waiting for the engagement of the Anglican safeguarding team to enable a joint approach to be taken. When it was clear that such engagement was not forthcoming (whether for reasons of sickness or anything else), the Catholic safeguarding team should have gone back to the local authority designated officer (the LADO) and recommended that they continue without further input from the Church of England."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì The trust have themselves admitted the failures reflected in an independent report they commissioned after the death, that report said úwe would not expect a patients level of risk to be downgraded from high ¶ to medium immediately following a suicide attemptù; In addition I heard evidence in relation to the assessment on the 26th July 2019 when the risk was downgraded from high to medium. I listened very carefully to the steps that the Trust has taken to make changes following this death and I am pleased that a number of changes have taken place. I raised my concern about the downgrading of risk from high to medium in this case by two members of the team that had no previous dealings with Maria. Maria was well known to the trust and her own care coordinator said úWe were concerned about the ongoing risk of completed suicide given she continued to be in possession of a helium bottle, the risk was not considered to have changed since my first meeting with her when the risk to self was recorded as highù. That was a reference to a multidisciplinary meeting which took place a matter of weeks before her death. I was told that risk is dynamic and that professionals assess risk at the time and that it can go up and down. I was also told that there are lots of assessments by staff that do not know patients. That said there is a concern that there is a risk of future death - is it right that the risk of a patient, who is well known to the trust, with a care coordinator who knew her well, is downgraded without any check put in place."

This was | Because no effective system for making such referrals tothe relevant Local thoy appeared tobe In place atthe prison atthe time ofthese events. The Sater Custody team were responsibe for making such rteral, but embers ofthat team suggested mn evidence that they had insufcient time to dea wth such sues. The Safer Custody lead at the me ofthese events (gave evidence as flows: {2 social care referral, onthe correct form as per the pison's Adut Safeguarding Poly. was never made (b) such referral should have been made within days of Mr. Hutonôs artvat atthe prison (c) he was unable to explain why the system had broken down, but agreed that offcers within his team ad then, and continue to have insufficient time to devote to Equally & Disability issues: (@) there i stl no traning in place to ensure that officers are abe o identi the need fora social cae releral, and know how to make such a referral (2) There appears to be no effective system for allocating ACCT Case Managers at HMP Long Larin. The officer (Officer A) wo, when she pened the final ACCT document fr Mr. Hutton, appointed hersefas Case | Manager or his ACCT, dd so knowing that she would have no contact with rim over the Following two weeks. Officer A gave evidence that {@) this was common pracce at the prison (6) officers were discouraged from not naming a Case Manager when they pened an ACCT, even if (35 here )t was opened at right (o) she was hoping that another offcer might take it over from her. [As he predicted, se herself id indeed have no further contact with Mr. Hutton Furthermore, this problem was not passed on or identified, and no other oer took over the Case Manager role. Therefore there was NO ttlecve oversight of an ACCT involving a potentially very vunerable Indivedual Of particular concern is that another officer appears to have filed in Officer Xs details inthe ""name"" and signatureù boxes atthe foot of the ACCT Garemap, and dated them 72.19 the day before Mr. Hutton's death ). thereby ging the impression that Oficer Ahad reviewed and satisfied herself thatthe actions identified in the Caremap had been dea with. Infact. the most important acton on the Caremap, which required a social care eferal, had not been complete. J This lack of fective oversight was not confined to Mr. Hutton's final ACCT document. For his fist ACCT document at HMP Long Larin, only a month earlier the named Case Manager had no involvement with unt the fourth ACCT Case Review, and made no enties on the Caremap ( which was signed of by a diferent officer) | near evidence from @ member ofthe curent Senior Management Team at the prison that (a) there is currently no formal training forthe allocation of, or flfiment ofthe duties ofthe ACCT Case Manager tle (b) this wl be reviewed, and training wil be organised.

https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/mark-culverhouse/,2021-0189,6/2/2021,The Rt Hon Robert Buckland QC Lord Chancellor Ministry of Justice,"The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows: During the course of the inquest into the death of Mark Culverhouse it became apparent, and indeed was accepted that his detention at HMP Woodhill from the 18th of April 2019 until the 23rd of April 2019 was unlawful. He had been recalled under the terms of his license having been released from Peterborough prison on the 12th of April 2019. The calculation of his release date was not conducted by the offender management unit at the prison until the 23rd of April 2019, after the extended Easter bank holiday. I was told that there was no process in place whereby a prisonerís release is calculated until such time as they come back into custody. The prison and probation ombudsman brought this matter to the attention of the prison service recommending that the release date calculation should take place within one working day of the prisoner arriving in prison. I cannot see how that can be acceptable particularly where, in Mr Culverhouseís case, it would have made no difference because of the bank holiday. I consider that there was a clear link between his unlawful detention and his eventual death on the 24th of April 2019 and, in order to prevent similar deaths in the future, I believe an urgent review is required and the system changed to ensure that the calculation of the release date is made prior to the decision to recall being taken. This will avoid the possibility of anyone being unlawfully imprisoned in this country under similar circumstances."

(2) NHS England.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) There did not appear to be any national guidance or standards that directed or encouraged appropriate sharing of risk information and care plans with the local pharmacy. As a result, the pharmacy was unsighted on the fact that the treating psychiatric team had a safety plan involving Samôs parents being responsible for handling and administering all medication. Had the pharmacy been aware of this plan, it is likely that they would either have refused to provide the medication with which Sam overdosed or, at least, contacted Samôs parents or General Practitioner. (2) A local protocol has now been introduced whereby the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Foundation Trustôs Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service ensures that any pharmacy used regularly by their patients aged 16-17 are (where appropriate) advised of relevant care plans, as well as the responsible GP being so informed. This is now to be part of mandatory training for CAMHS prescribing staff and is to be discussed in the local Joint Prescribing Group to ensure better communication between the local NHS Trusts, G.P.s and local pharmacies. Accordingly, action has already been taken in the local area to prevent similar fatalities. However, (3) I am concerned that there is a risk of future fatalities if action is not taken at a national level to ensure that pharmacies are appropriately involved in medication safety plans for mental health patients aged 16 ì 17, given that such patients may otherwise be able to obtain prescribed medication with which to overdose."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) Following completed suicides on the railway network BTP and Network Rail are both involved in considering further mitigating measures that may be appropriate at the location to guard against further fatalities. (2) In Chrisô case, earlier consideration to the fence boundary being a credible route of access may have led to the fence boundary being improved more quickly after her death. (3) I am concerned that your investigation into, and consideration of, Chrisô death did not keep a sufficiently open mind that she may have climbed the boundary fence to access the railway line. If similar assumptions are made in other investigations, there is a risk of future fatalities: there is a risk that mitigating measures will be missed if BTP and Network Rail too readily assume that one point of access to the railway was used when the evidence permits of credible alternative routes of access. Accordingly, I am concerned that action should be taken in the sphere of guidance in keeping an open mind in post-death investigations but the nature of any appropriate action to be taken is for your organisations to consider."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- (1) Overnight assistance for adolescent mental health patients being cared for at home but with high levels of need (For CPFT and CCC). I heard evidence of increased funding for CPFT being used to extend home treatment options, but that this would be unlikely to extend to a 24/7 service. I also heard evidence from CCC that available support would now be considered under s17 Children Act or s117 Mental Health Act or both but that this would need to be jointly funded between social care and health. I remain concerned that a clear pathway to securing overnight assistance (even if only on a respite basis) for similar cases of exceptional need has not yet been clearly agreed between CPFT and CCC. I am concerned that if alternative supported accommodation in the community were the best solution, there does not appear to be provision for it in-area, so that admission to a mental health unit becomes more likely. (2) Involvement of CCC alongside CPFT in complex adolescent mental health cases where the risk is of suicide / self-harm (For CCC). In some respects CCCôs involvement in Chris and Samôs care (social care and education) lacked direction, focus, knowledge and efficiency. I heard evidence of improvements in training in the relevant education and social work teams, and concerning the new Strong Families, Strong Communities Securing Best Outcomes for Children Strategy (March 2021). Further, that CCC is restructuring all of its early help and adolescent services and will be implementing a formal contextual safeguarding framework and that these developments will be in place by the end of 2021. I am concerned that in the midst of restructuring and new guidance, there remains a risk that education inclusion officers and social workers on the ground may still not have sufficient knowledge, guidance and supervision to ensure that CCC give practical and robust support to parents and adolescent patients, alongside treating healthcare agencies, where the main risk of serious harm to the child is from self- harm or suicide arising from adolescent mental health disorders, rather than neglect of harm by a third party. (3) Diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (For CPFT). I am concerned that the evidence in Chrisô case, in particular, suggested a degree of age-related reluctance consistently to use the terminology of Borderline Personality Disorder (or Emerging Personality Disorder or EUPD), even when a highly specialist second opinion had supported this and appeared to have been accepted. There are risks associated with a reluctance to use a personality disorder diagnosis (c.f. Position Statement from the Royal College of Psychiatrists dated January 2020). I received evidence that there have already been some changes/improvements in the preparedness to recognise Borderline Personality Disorder and that further consideration will be given in the context of the new ICD 11. (4) AWOL patients from Darwin Centre for Young People (For CPFT). I heard evidence that since Chrisô death, staff have been reminded of the applicable policies; and that an audit has shown good compliance with the provision for calling the local signallers. I heard evidence that there is to be a further review of CPFTôs own AWOL policy. I remain concerned that: (i) CPFTôs own policy is too lengthy and complex to serve as reference-guidance during a live AWOL incident. In particular the flow chart summary is unnecessarily complex and hard to follow (at least as a tool to consult during a stressful incident); (ii) there is a risk of confusion in having two policies both of which are meant to be followed; (iii) there did not appear be desktop-drills / other training exercises / information grab-packs (etc.) to ensure that all nurses in charge are properly equipped and trained to deal with AWOL incidents efficiently (iv) steps ought to be taken at managerial level to ensure that the confusion over the two policies and whether one had been superseded (evidence of which only emerged during the inquest) cannot recur in this, or other areas, when new policies are introduced. 4"

She complained of sensations which included feeling that her insides eli, that she hed hot lavaô and snakes inher stomachô and a brain haemorrhage causing Wicking in her headù Hormonal tests Undertaken during the admission estabished that the Deceased was post-menopausal, The Consultant PPeychitrist with responsibilty forthe Deceased was of the opinion that the sensations where related tothe menopause rather than a psychosis. A GP trainee spoke to a Gynaecology Registrar who advised that HRT was contraindicated and recommended the use of herbal alleratves. The Deceased declined to take the herbal allornative and was discharged from the ward on 2 July 2020 on ant-psychote medication. The Consultant Psychiatrist recommendation that a referral be made by primary care to Gynaecology to discuss [HRT atternatves was not communicated tothe Deceased GP. On 21 July 2020, the Deceased was re-admtied to Aspen Ward ater being located in woodland. She had been missing for 7 days with the express inlenton that she starve herself to death. During her second mission, her anti-psychotic medication was increased. The Consuitant Psychiat formulated a diagnosis of profound menopause with secondary kinaestheic hallucinatory experiences.ù These dagnosis does nat feature in ICD-10 and a second opinion was nol requested or obtained by the Consultant Psychiatrist. No contact was made with the Speciast Pharmacist attached to the locality to establish whether HRT was Coniraindcated and no further contact was made with the Gynaecology team.

https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/matthew-mackell/,2021-0177,5/25/2021,Chief Constable Kent Police; IOPC;,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) In December 2019 a software update had been installed to a system in the Kent Force Control room which, if used, produced a much greater accuracy in detecting the location of mobile phone calls. There had been inadequate or no training on the use of the update which resulted in the system not being deployed to locate the deceased. The call from the deceased at 22.18 was therefore incorrectly downgraded as the area to search was regarded as too wide to be effective. The downgrade was incorrect because (a) the use of the software would have provided an accurate location and (b) the call should have been treated as a suicide call and not an abandoned 999 call. It is accepted that as a direct result of this incident the software system is now the default setting to detect locations. However, the evidence of those witnesses who were required to use the system raised a more general enquiry which identified gaps in or absence of effective training and the cascading of information. (2) The totality of the evidence from several experienced operatives in the Force Control Room revealed gaps in their knowledge as to operating procedure in respect of the suicide policy, appropriate downgrading of calls, checking available patrols. Whilst it is accepted that following an IOPC report steps have been taken to review and improve procedures, it was apparent that there was an absence of an effective system to identify those that required training/updating and of the keeping a record of the specific training/updating received by individual operatives and the date it was undertaken. There did not appear to be a structured system in place to produce a regular training rotation which monitored and recorded individual satisfactory progress.

Chief Executive of Oxford Health NHS Trust,During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì Evidence was heard that: (1) There was no clear care plan in place following an emergency review of Mrs Thompson on 13th March 2020 (2) The care plans and risk assessments at the mental health Trust were not updated: (a) with material information on the facts and circumstances of Mrs Thompsonôs overdoses of her medication. (b) the two most recent overdoses were not recorded (c) with further information disclosed by the doctor who treated her most recent overdose that Mrs Thompson had lied about the severity of her overdose that it was probably double that which she initially disclosed also that this was her 4th overdose and another could not be ruled out. (d) on 13th March 2020 following a review with the Trust Consultant Psychiatrist (e) on 13th March 2020 when there was a telephone conversation between Mrs Thompson and her care co-ordinator

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: The Deceased was suffering from a mental illness and had been non-compliant with this anti-depressant medication. The system for repeat prescriptions does not currently allow for alerts to be sent to a patient to remind them to request and collect their repeat prescription to encourage compliance. An automated alert to a patient could be added to the EMIS system, which would not increase the burden on the GPs and administrative staff at the surgery."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. The inquest heard that information regarding the risk of self-harm to Stephen was passed by his family to his treating clinicians and his care coordinator but this was not taken into account as Stephen denied a recent attempt to take his own life. What steps could be taken to ensure family information is taken into account in the relevant care plan and risk assessments. 2. The inquest heard that there is no designated gap between service user appointments to allow care coordinators to write up their detailed notes contemporaneously. 3. expressed they were both suffering with a severe effect on their mental health but their care needs as the main carers was not built in to any long term plan.
https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/hannah-bampfylde/,2021-0136,5/5/2021," , Chief Executive, Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Swandean, Arundel Road, Worthing, West Sussex BN13 3EP","Hannah Bampfylde had a long history of mental health problems and was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Following a settled period, her mental health deteriorated leading to the attempted overdose in October 2019. Following an unsuccessful referral to Time to Talk services, Hannah was referred to HATS, the entry point into specialist mental health services. Assessment appointments were made for 26th November 2019, which 3 Hannah did not attend, and 4th December 2019, which was altered at short notice by HATS to 6th December 2019, when Hannah was at work. No further appointments were made by HATS and Hannah did not contact the service herself to reschedule. Hannahôs GP was not made aware that she had missed appointments and that she was not therefore effectively under the care of the service until HATS wrote to the GP on 1st April 2020 advising them that Hannah had been discharged for non- engagement. Whilst there was not sufficient evidence before the Court to conclude that the lack of an assessment by HATS and therefore Mental Health Services input into Hannahôs care caused or contributed to her death, the evidence highlighted a lack of clarity and potential for persons newly referred to the service to not engage without their GP being aware of this. The two GPs who had contact with Hannah both stated they were unaware of any protocols being in place, either at the time of Hannahôs death or in the interim, to ensure all non-engagement with services should be communicated with the patientôs GP, although the Trustôs own Serious Incident Report into Hannahôs death identified that such a protocol should be in place. HATS use the Trustôs úActive Engagement Incorporating Did Not Attend (DNA) Policy & Procedureù (úthe Policyù) in governing the standards of how to promote engagement with service users, to include those awaiting assessment and those already under the care of the service. The Policy provides general guidance to professionals in deciding on the action to be taken when a person does not attend an appointment with them, but does not give a clear pathway to avoid newly referred patients slipping through the system. From the evidence given to the Court, it was not clear who was responsible for re-booking appointments in the event of a DNA, or at what stage non-attendances should be escalated for review with the Referrals Co-ordinator. The Policy describes a úMulti-Disciplinary Review Meetingù taking place prior to a non-attending person being discharged back to primary care, but this does not apply to new referrals to the HATS where a Multi- Disciplinary team would not be in place and discussion would instead take place between the Assessor and Referrals Co-ordinator. There was no detail of this discussion in Hannahôs notes although evidence was given that it had taken place. 4 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: - Appointments are not automatically re-booked when a person has failed to attend an appointment. - It is not clear who should re-book appointments when a person has failed to attend (Administration or Assessors). - GPs are not routinely notified if a person has not attended an appointment with the HATS, meaning the GP would be unaware the person was not receiving input from the HATS until they had failed to attend a number of appointments and were discharged back to primary care, potentially many months after being referred. Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to address the above concerns."

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Ms, Leven was found dead at her home on 26th March 2020 as a consequence of asphyxia which was self-induced with the intention of bringing about her death. Ms. Leven was under the care of community mental health services having previously been diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder arising rom traumatic experiences in childhood. As a result of her Personality Disorder, Ms. Leven had frequently self: harmed andlor attempted suicide, often telling others what she had done. A major Protective factor in maintaining Ms. Leven's safely was her dog. In February 2020, Ms. Leven's dog became seriously unwell, This led o @ profound deterioration in her mental health. After Ms. Leven's dog was euthanized in March 2020, she cut her groin and took a mixed overdose, resulting in her being taken to hospital. Whilst she received treatment there for hher physical health, Ms Leven left hospital before the mental health liaison team could assess her. Despite the ciear deterioration in Ms. Leven's health, the removal of the major protective factor in maintaining her safely and her e-mailing her care coordinator | to inform him she intended to complete suicide after leaving hospital, no comprehensive mental health assessment took place.

It appears he believed, incorrectly, that there was a Vulnerable Prisoner Unit (VPU) at HMPL. Staff at HMPG accepted Mr Adams had asked about a VPU but the fact there was no such unit at HMPL was not relayed back to him. There was no evidence to say that he would have been placed on a \VPU even if there had been one at HMPL. Mr Adams had a history of being. unsettled when moved, even within a prison. The jury found that there was insufficient information regarding Mr Adam's on his transfer and arrival at HMPL, Within 24 hours of arrival his mental health deteriorated to such an extent he was placed on an ACCT. There were insufficient records of his behaviour in the ACCT and a full picture of his mental health was not recorded. Darren was alive at 0641, hours on 12"" November 2017 but discovered lgatured in his cell at 0738 hours. The officer discovering Mr Adams waited for additional staff assistance before attempting to enter the cell however Darren had erected a barricade at his door which caused an additional slight delay in accessing him. Once the door was opened and barricade removed nursing staff from prison healthcare entered the cell. The nursing staff carried out a clinical assessment but misdiagnosed him, Believing him to have hypostasis and rigor mortis. They decided not to commence CCPR. The nurses had previously been advised by the Prison Service and Probation Ombudsman against commencing CPR when someone is obviously deceased. They referred to the guidance úGuidance to support the decision-making process of when not to perform Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in prisons and immigration removal centre (IRC)"". When paramedics arrived their clinical assessment found no hhypostasis, no rigor morts and they also stated he was stil warm. They commenced CPR and obtained a return of spontaneous circulation 4 times, the last as he was conveyed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary (ORI).

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 2 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì The evidence clearly identified a gap in service provision in the Norfolk and Waveney area for the cohort of patients into which Sean fitted. Although having been identified as ARMS by the EIPT in Norfolk and Waveney, Sean nonetheless did not fit the strict criteria for accessing that service as he was deemed to have not yet suffered a first episode of psychosis; however his level of risk was sufficiently high that he was also considered unsuitable for WBS. Additionally, the evidence confirmed that Sean did not fit the criteria of either the Community Mental Health Team, the Crisis Team or MIND. In contrast, in the neighbouring Suffolk area (and the evidence suggested in many other areas of the country) ARMS patients are recognised as falling under the commissioned EIPT umbrella and therefore receive commissioned assessment, treatment and management from that team. This lacunae in service provision in Norfolk and Waveney meant that, at the time of his death, Sean fell between services and did not receive any appropriate care. In my opinion the continuation of such a lacunae in commissioned service provision gives rise to the risk of future deaths."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. Mary was discharged from the Abraham Cowley Unit without a discharge planning meeting taking place in circumstances where there was no confirmation that she was eligible for housing provision and with no plan was to what would happen after the Travel Lodge placement ended. There is no policy in place which prevents a vulnerable patient being discharged into homelessness from the Abraham Cowley Unit. 2. Mary was not subject to a medical review from the 28th March 2018 to the 26th May 2018. There is no policy in place which mandates when or if a patient should be subject to face to face review by a consultant psychiatrist after discharge from the acute unit. 3. No formal risk assessment was undertaken of Mary and no risk assessment was recorded in her records prior to her discharge from the Abraham Cowley Unit. 4. The informal risk assessments undertaken in the Abraham Cowley Unit prior to her discharge failed to place any weight on the impact on Mary of a discharge with an inchoate plan for her housing and arrived at an incorrect assessment of her risk. The risk assessments were not sufficiently rigorous and evidence based. 5. Mary was prematurely discharged from the Abraham Cowley Unit suffering from severe depression and before sufficient time had been taken to observe the effectiveness of her prescribed medication. This appears in part to have been because the imperative to discharge patients took precedence over adequate discharge planning and assessment. The CPA ( ú Care Programme Approachù) was not followed. 6. Mary was discharged from the Home Treatment team on ineffective medication and without any coherent plan for her care in the community. Her care coordinator was not involved in the discharge planning. The CPA was not followed. 7. The fact that she was placed out of area made it difficult for her to participate in community based treatment and significantly impacted on the ability of her care coordinator and community psychiatrist to support her. There is no policy which governs how often a patient should be seen once in the community in order to review the risk assessment and monitor compliance with medication.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì The Trust had systems and procedures in place in relation to the referral by the Community Mental Health Team to the Psychological Therapies Services, but there did not appear to be in a place a reliable or established system which would ensure that the service-user would receive direct contact from the Trust, tailored to their particular situation and condition to ensure that they were fully informed as to the fact, status and plan for their referral. The acknowledgement letter which was intended to be delivered to Ms Hussain was a pro-forma which gave no indication as to what she should expect, beyond the information that she had been placed on a waiting list. It does not appear that the procedures in place take account of the likely needs of the service-users who are by definition, seeking assistance with mental illness. It is understood that the Community Transformation Project is currently in the process of reviewing the mental health service, but there is no timescale available over which the question of referrals will be considered. Pending that review, my concern is that the level and method of communication with those being referred to the service does not take account of their particular needs and may affect their mental health."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you On the evidence heard at inquest, it appears when a patient is admitted to a bed within a Mental Health Trust out of their normal locality (in this case County Durham, when the patient lived in London) there was no national policy to co-ordinate the transfer of patients back to their 'Home' area. It appears there was no agreed escalation policy when a bed could not be obtained and no agreed process to 'apply' for a bed in another Trust area. It is of concern as the arrangements at the present time seem to be ad Hoc in nature and may as such create delay in any transfer of patients."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) (1) Patient notes in the Accident and Emergency Department at the Princess Royal In circumstances where a patient attends A & E at the PRH with a mental health concern they can be seen by a Senior Nurse Practitioner or a Doctor working for SPFT who assesses them; however patient care remains the responsibility of PRH. SPFT have reviewed their practice so that a contemporaneous note of their consultation is copied from Carenotes and placed in the A & E paper notes. Evidence from a PRH witness at the Inquest confirmed that Mr Costelloôs paper notes should have been updated every 2-3 hours to provide an accurate account of how he was progressing. The witness indicated that the notes themselves which PRH staff use (paper notes) needed updating and reviewing. This had been done previously for the PRH but then discarded following review by a Senior Nurse at the A & E department at Royal Sussex County Hospital which is also run by the same Trust. It is requested that the Trust consider updating the A and E notes on both sites at the very earliest opportunity and to include note of the need to regularly update them in line with policies and that all staff in A & E receive training on the need to complete those notes regularly with emphasis on the importance of recognising the notes as a vital tool in recording and evaluating a patientôs condition.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: - The purpose of undertaking a Serious Untoward Incident Investigation, is to identify necessary organisational changes which can improve the outcomes for patients and hopefully prevent future deaths. Rory had been discharged from acute services and was under the care of his General Practitioner. In keeping with many people he had been involved with different arms of ABUHB (primary, acute and psychiatric) He had been involved with social services. After his death the charity MIND wrote to me and expressed concerns that Rory had fallen between gaps in services. This was addressed in the internal investigation undertaken by ABUHB, however it is surprising that his GP was not involved in this review and Dr e told me that GPs are rarely asked to participate in these investigations. In order that lessons can be learned and opportunities identified for better partnership working around patients, it would seem appropriate that the patient's Tris obvious that Rory was vulnerable and yet there was no statutory monitoring arranged because he did not fll squarely into a box of social, physical or mental health Rory continued to ruminate over ending his ite At about Sam on 9/10/18.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. On the 4th May 2020 Azra's mother and daughter had been in telephone contact with the nurse in charge on the ward expressing concerns that Azra had messaged them to say she had attempted suicide using shoelaces as a ligature. The nurse spoke to Azra who denied making a ligature, Azra's neck was examined and she had no marks from ligature use. The shoelaces from one pair of shoes were removed but other shoelaces, clothing and bedding were left in her possession as it was felt that Azra was not at an immediate risk. She was not believed to be at immediate risk because, whilst it was a feature of her mental state common to many patients that she would regularly talk about not wanting to live and requesting an overdose, there was no evidence that she had made an active suicide attempt and she had no history of suicide or self-harm attempts. The fact that she was now saying that she had attempted to make a ligature was a change in her presentation (her previous suicidal ideation had centred around requesting assistance to overdose), it was also of significance that she was saying one thing to her family and something different to a clinician. BSMHT accepted that the information was significant and therefore there ought to have been consideration of it by her treating team with a review of her risk and observation levels. However, no record at all was made of the family's concerns and the account given by Azra. Her risk screen was not updated, an incident report was not raised, and the information was not included in handover to the next shift or at the next MDT on the 6th May. Therefore, it was not considered at an MDT meeting on the 6th May 2020. Due to the COVID19 pandemic Azra's family could not attend that meeting and raise their concerns directly. Microsoft Teams was used by some clinicians to attend the MDT on the 6th May but was not made available to Azra's family nor was a telephone number to dial into the meeting. BSMHT has put in a system for a form to be completed in advance of an MDT which requires the family's input to be sought, placed on the form and considered in the MDT. It is my concern that this is equivalent to the family being included in the meeting (prior to COVID families were invited to attend MDTs): there is the potential that information will not be recorded accurately or will not be understood in written form, it also doesn't afford family the opportunity to hear the plan arising from the meeting and provide their views. There is no reason why attendance by a remote platform or telephone line at the meeting itself cannot be offered to family for all MDTs. 2. BSMHT had risk assessed ward 2 for ligature points, including the en-suite bathrooms, in November 2019. The en-suite bathroom doors were given the highest risk score possible on an acute ward, but no corrective action was identified to remove or mitigate the risk: the risk assessment relied on clinical assessment and observation of the service user to mitigate the risk. Evidence was given at the inquest that pressure sensor alarms have been available in the UK from numerous manufacturers for 10 years, BSMHT had been investigating and testing different pressure sensor alarms for en-suite bathroom doors for approximately 2 years before Azra's death. BSMHT has now identified an appropriate pressure sensor for en-suite bathroom doors and the en-suite bathroom door of room 14 on ward 2 was replaced in November 2020 with a door incorporating a pressure sensor alarm. BSMHT has a 17 month program to fit pressure sensor alarms to all en-suite bathroom doors within its inpatient units. However, this is not being considered for other doors within the bedroom area nor is there any national requirement for in- patient mental health units to place, or consider placing, pressure sensor alarms on doors within areas where patients are afforded privacy and time alone. I am concerned that within BSMHT's inpatient units there will be a continuing risk from other doors in the bedroom area (including the main bedroom door) even when the en-suite bathroom doors are fitted with pressure sensor alarms. Although the outer face of a bedroom door will be on a communal corridor, service users on level 1 and 2 observations will have periods where they are unobserved in their rooms and could wedge a ligature at the top of a door so that it wasn't obviously visible from outside. Furthermore, in the absence of any national regulations or guidance on this topic the risk from en-suite and other doors in areas where service users spend time unobserved will persist in mental health units operated by other Trusts and private providers around the country."

She was assessed as being at low to moderate risk to herself. However, she was not asked if she would agree to her family being notified of the situation and of her current mental ill health. Her son would dearly like to have been told what was happening and would have acted accordingly. I heard evidence that iCope does not routinely ask their patients if families may be involved. This seems to be a policy worthy of reconsideration. 2. The 72 hour investigation report that should be produced within 72 hours of death, to enable fast learning that may be of immediate benefit to other patients, was not completed until last week, some five months after Ms Walczakôs death.

https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/jaden-francois-espirit/,2021-0048,2/22/2021,1. Commissioner London Fire Brigade 169 Union Street London SE1 0LL,"2 During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Unbeknown to those with whom he worked at Wembley Fire Station, Jadenôs mental well being was deteriorating significantly in the last weeks of his life, and it deteriorated to the point where he killed himself. I heard at inquest that the London Fire Brigade has quite sophisticated systems in place to support firefighters suffering mental ill health. However, Jaden was not offered the support of, for example, psychological counselling, because it was not appreciated that he was so very low. Obviously if firefighters are to be given the best chance of recovering from mental ill health, their difficulties first need to be recognised. I appreciate that it can be difficult to detect that a person may be depressed or exceptionally unhappy. Signs may be subtle and require a nuanced approach. ÔÇ∑ Jaden often complained that he was bored because Wembley Green Watch had not been called to many incidents. I heard evidence that boredom in a new firefighter can be quite common. However, I also heard that a complaint of boredom can be a sign of a person with dyslexia avoiding an unpalatable or daunting task. ÔÇ∑ Jaden had dyslexia and was worried that he would not be able to complete his written work in order to become a fully qualified firefighter, yet the reality was that his station officer was fully aware of his difficulties and had tried to reassure Jaden that he was certainly capable of achieving his goal. ÔÇ∑ He did need extra time, the space to make mistakes and a degree of sensitivity that was not always afforded him. On the other hand, he asked for help and was given a mentor, but did not make use of him and so eventually the mentorship ceased. That request for help followed by a refusal of help was not explored. Such an exploration might have led to a greater understanding of how Jaden could be helped. ÔÇ∑ Jaden felt he was being treated unfairly at work and his family have formed the view that there was an element of racism there, driven in part by their belief that Jaden was the only non white person on Wembley Green Watch. Yet the reality was that he joined a watch where a quarter of the firefighters were people of colour. 3 ÔÇ∑ He described being teased about bringing chicken, rice and peas to work to eat, thinking that this teasing was because the food was Caribbean. Looking at this from the outside, chicken, rice and peas seems a dish without obvious world origin. Moreover, I heard about a huge variety of food being brought to work by firefighters, with some even weighing their food before eating. None of this sits easily with a dish of chicken, rice and peas resulting in a racist comment. Jadenôs interior life did not always accord with what was going on around him. Most of all he felt isolated, and yet it was clear to me that he there was a lot of affection for him at the fire station. He did not always feel comfortable there. It is not necessarily an easy task to unearth such feelings in a colleague but, if it results in such a tragedy as this being avoided, it is a worthwhile one. I should be grateful if you, or whoever you delegate to investigate this matter, would listen to the entirety of the recording of this inquest. The London Fire Brigade investigation report already produced, talks in some detail about the station culture. There were so many different aspects to the evidence that, without listening to the whole inquest, I am afraid that any understanding will not be as meaningful as it could be."

The inquest was resumed on 4 February 2021 and the conclusion was handed down on 5 February 2021. The medical cause of Mr Dent-Jonesôs death was: 1a. Tramadol Toxicity 2. Coronary Artery Disease The inquest concluded with a short-from conclusion of Drug-Related Deathô and a Narrative Conclusion as set out below. E 2 Drug-Related Death. The Approved Premises Manual 2014 (Version 2), which was in force at the time and remains in force, states that residents in Approved Premises should not be allowed to collect their prescribed medication themselves. The Approved Premises Manual requires each Approved Premises to have a system in place so that the residentsô prescribed medication can be provided directly to staff at the Approved Premises. There was a failure on the part of the National Probation Service, contrary to the Approved Premises Manual, to set up such a system at St. Catherineôs Priory and as a result Mr Dent-Jones was able to gain access to his Tramadol prescription which he then overdosed on resulting in his death.ô 5 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 10 March 1994 Mr Dent-Jones received a life sentence with a minimum term of 12 years. Whilst he was in prison he was suspected of misusing alcohol and prescription and illicit drugs. On 27 September 2017 Mr Dent-Jones was released on licence to an Approved Premises in Brighton run by the National Probation Service. On 2 November 2017 he was recalled to prison for breaching the conditions of his licence, due to a pattern of alcohol and drug misuse which culminated in his admission to hospital due to suspected illicit drug use. On 15 November 2017, whilst Mr Dent-Jonesô was in prison, his prescription for Tramadol, which was prescribed in relation to chronic back pain, was stopped by the healthcare team due to concerns that he was pretending to swallow the tablets when they were dispensed to him but was in fact concealing them. On 9 July 2018 Mr Dent-Jones was again released on licence, on this occasion to St Catherineôs Priory, an Approved Premises in Guildford, also run by the National Probation Service. E 3 On his arrival at St.Catherineôs Priory, Mr Dent-Jones was assessed as not being suitable to keep his medication in his own possession due to his history of drug abuse and he agreed to hand in his prescribed medication to staff. On 11 July 2018 Mr Dent-Jones registered at Dapdune House GP Surgery in Guildford and requested a prescription of Tramadol for long standing back pain. He informed the prescribing GP that he had been taking Tramadol for many years and that he got withdrawal symptoms if he did not take it. The records available to the prescribing GP at the time confirmed that Mr Dent-Jones had had a long-term prescription for Tramadol. However, the prescribing GP was not aware that Mr Dent- Jones had a history of drug abuse or that his prescription of Tramadol had been stopped in November 2017 due to concerns that he had been concealing the tablets. Accordingly, a prescription of Tramadol tablets was issued to Mr Dent-Jones and Mr Dent-Jones subsequently collected the prescription from Dapdune House Pharmacy. Mr Dent-Jones did not inform staff at St.Catherineôs Priory that he had obtained the Tramadol tablets or hand them in. On 14 July 2018 Mr Dent-Jones was found deceased in his bed at St Catherineôs Priory, having last been known to be alive at approximately 11pm the night before. Mr Dent-Jonesô death was caused by an unintentional overdose of Tramadol, and contributed to by his Coronary Artery Disease, which reduced his cardiac reserve. The inquest concluded with the following short-form and narrative conclusion as set out in Box 4 above. E 4 6 CORONERôS CONCERNS The Coronerôs concerns are as follows: During the course of the inquest the court heard the following evidence: - The National Probation Service Approved Premises Manual 2014 requires Approved Premises to put in place a local procedure for the collection/delivery of residentsô prescribed medication. The residents are not to be permitted to collect it themselves; - In December 2018 the National Probation Service introduced the Safe Working Practices Document which sets out NPS policies and procedures in relation to various aspects of resident safety. Each Approved Premises is required to adapt the document to include their local procedure in respect of the delivery/collection of residentsô prescribed medication. Each Approved Premises is also required to maintain a Register confirming that every member of staff has read and understood the Safe Working Practices Document for the particular Approved Premises they work in. - However, the Area Manager for Approved Premises in Surrey, Sussex and Bedfordshire gave evidence that prior to the inquest she had not previously been aware of the requirement to set up a system for the delivery/collection of prescribed medication as set out in the Approved Premises Manual 2014 and she had not previously seen a copy of the Safe Working Practices Document 2018. - The witness also gave evidence that until very recently there had not been no procedure in place for the collection/delivery of residentsô prescribed medication at St. Catherineôs Priory in Guildford or at the Approved Premises in Brighton. - The National Probation Service was unable to provide the court with a copy of the Safe Working Practices Document for St. Catherineôs Priory. - St. Catherineôs Priory does not have a Register confirming that every member of staff had read and understood the Safe Working Practices Document. E 5 Accordingly I am concerned that: - Staff at St Catherineôs Priory Approved Premises in Guildford, as well as staff in other Approved Premises nationally, may not be familiar with, or applying, the guidance set out in the Safe Working Practices Document in relation to the delivery/collection of residentsô prescribed medication, but also more generally in relation to the other policies and procedures pertaining to resident safety in that document. The MATTER OF CONCERN is: - Staff at St Catherineôs Priory Approved Premises in Guildford, as well as staff in other Approved Premises nationally, may not be familiar with, or applying, the guidance set out in the Safe Working Practices Document in relation to the delivery/collection of residentsô prescribed medication, but also more generally in relation to the other policies and procedures pertaining to resident safety in that document. 7 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the people listed in paragraph one above have the power to take such action. 8 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date; I may extend that period on request. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì The evidence before the inquest was that GMP had not recorded the assault with a weapon as a crime within the crime recording system.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 3 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. The inquest heard that psychology assessment and therapies can be very beneficial to those with mental health issues in secondary services as well as primary services. The evidence given was that the delay that Mrs Mitchell experienced in accessing that service was reflective of both the regional and national backlog for appointments. The inquest was told that the position had worsened since 2019 and for example someone in Mrs Mitchellôs position today would be more likely to wait 9 months than the 7 months in 2019. 2. Mrs Mitchell on two occasions could not be accommodated locally when an inpatient stay was required. The evidence heard at the inquest was that this was due to limited national mental health bed capacity against the demand within mental health services. The inquest heard evidence that suggested that this impacted on how she could be supported by her family and overall care. 3. It was accepted at the inquest that information gathering from family could be beneficial. However, there was a reluctance by health professionals to fully utilise information gathering due to concerns about breaching patient confidentiality. This appeared to stem from a misunderstanding between the concept of information sharing and information gathering and how they inter related with the principle of patient confidentiality."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you On the evidence heard at inquest, it appears when a patient is admitted to a bed within a Mental Health Trust out of their normal locality (in this case County Durham, when the patient lived in London) there was no national policy to co-ordinate the transfer of patients back to their 'Home' area. It appears there was no agreed escalation policy when a bed could not be obtained and no agreed process to 'apply' for a bed in another Trust area. It is of concern as the arrangements at the present time seem to be ad Hoc in nature and may as such create delay in any transfer of patients."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) The transfer and review of prisoners on an ACCT. I am concerned in relation to the ability of any Prison to close an ACCT, with the attendance of 2 individuals (a prison and health care staff), after a short period of time on a newly transferred inmate (i.e. to a new prison) before anyone has had the time to review and assess him or her. For ACCTs created on current inmates within an establishment, who are known to staff, I do not see that as an issue, they would already have an existing knowledge and relationship and indeed would have been the originator of the ACCT in any event. However, for new prisoners, who have arrived from another prison establishment with an open ACCT on their record, I consider the ability to remove that individual from the ACCT, within a short period of time, does raise issues in respect of the knowledge and understanding of that individual and the ability of various agencies, within the prison, to have had time to review and communicate between themselves, about that individual. The provision of in effect 2 noô answers by a prisoner, is a potentially easy way of coming off an ACCT, which is there for their support and well-being, and I would suggest, given to easy manipulation I raise the issue as to whether there should be, for example, a set review period (e.g. 7 days) which allows time for the support services to meet with and interview the transferred inmate, interact, and then make a decision about and with the newly transferred prisoner on the ACCT before such an ACCT is closed."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. (1) The immediate needsô form completed for prisoners on arrival at HMP Belmarsh does not facilitate a clear assessment of any risk of self-harm or suicide and the actions to be taken if such a risk is identified. The form poses a question: úIs there any specific concerns re self-harm or suicide?ù and then gives the guidance úIf yes, amend care planù. However, this guidance is only effective for those prisoners who already have a care plan, meaning those who are already on an open Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCTô) plan. The action to be taken for those prisoners where specific concerns regarding self-harm or suicide are identified, but who do not already have a care plan, is unclear from the form. It is also unclear how the above question interacts with further questions below it which address any past ACCTs/F2052SHs, the level of support available to the prisoner and the answer the prisoner gives to the question úDo you feel suicidal now?ù Accordingly, this form does not sufficiently highlight prisoners who are in fact suicidal, or where there are concerns about their risk of self-harm or suicidal, to those on the wing. (2) The nightly roll checks at HMP Belmarsh are due to be carried out by a single member of Operational Support Grade (OSG) staff at 9.00 pm and 6.00 am. Their stated purpose is to check for escape or death among the prisoners. On handing over to the morning staff, the OSG signs paperwork indicating that the roll checks have been completed. There is no robust system by which the prison management audit this process. This means that the prison management can be under the impression that the checks have been carried out, when they have not been, as occurred here."

It is of concern as the arrangements at the present time seem to be ad Hoc in nature and may as such create delay in any transfer of patients."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì a) During the evidence there was some confusion amongst staff as to what was required of them when carrying out observations patients in their rooms. There were different practices adopted by different staff and there appeared to be a custom of not enteriing a patientôs room on the hourly observations so as not to disturb the patients. Sadly because of this practice it was unclear when Christopher had last been seen alive. Whilst the Trust has indicated that all staff have received further training in respect of this I am still not convinved that it is clear as to what is required by staff. b) Following the evidence the Jury concluded:- (a) that during Christopherôs time at Langley Green Hospital no formal review, care plan or adequate risk assessment was carried out in respect of his mental health. (b) that the nursing and clinical records were not kept in accordance with the trust health and record policy. (c) that here was no recorded evidence that any therapeutic engagement has taken place during the period of Christopherôs short stay. Whilst the Trust have indicated that there has been a review of the professional conduct of all staff involved in this case this does not allay my concerns that these practices are limited to just those staff involved in this case. c) Failure to provide staff to accompany a sectioned patient to the emergency department of another Hosptial for treatment for a physical condition. Requesting family member to undertake this role puts the patient and/or the family at risk"

It was resumed on 9 November 2020 with a jury and concluded on 20 November 2020. The medical cause of Miss Smithôs death was: 1a. Plastic Bag Asphyxia The inquest concluded with a short form conclusion of suicide and a narrative conclusion which is set out below. 2 5 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Kimberley Smith had been diagnosed with Depression, Anorexia Nervosa, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Emotional Unstable Personality Disorder and had a history of alcohol dependency and self- harm. On 20th September 2018, 29 September 2018 and 2 October 2018 she was admitted to hospital following attempts to take her own life whilst under the influence of alcohol. On 3 October 2018 Miss Smith was assessed under the Mental Health Act and admitted as an informal patient to the Abraham Cowley Unit (ACU), which is an inpatient psychiatric unit run by Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SABP) on the site of St. Peterôs Hospital. Following her admission she was begun on alcohol detoxification treatment and was assessed as being at high risk of suicide and/or self harm whilst intoxicated. On 5th October 2018 Miss Smith absconded from the ACU whilst out on unescorted leave and was taken to A&E at St. Peterôs Hospital by a member of the public before being returned to the ACU in a highly intoxicated state. On 6 October 2018 she was placed on a short-term section which was subsequently allowed to lapse on 9 October 2018. On 10th October 2018 she again absconded from the ACU following a period of escorted leave. She was returned to the ACU by a new acquaintance in the early hours of the 11th October 2018, again in a highly intoxicated state. On 12th October 2018 she left the ACU for several short periods of unescorted leave and returned as expected. She was then moved from 15 minute to hourly observations. At 15:20 she was signed out on unescorted leave and was expected back at 16.30 but she did not return. At approximately 19:30 and 22:30 on 12 October 2019 an acquaintance of Miss Smithôs called the ACU to say that she was intoxicated and that he was concerned about her. At 00.05 on 13th October2018, Kimberley Smith was returned to the car park of the Abraham Cowley Unit by the same acquaintance. However, she absconded before going back in to the unit 3 and the acquaintance handed over Miss Smithôs bag to ACU staff which contained bottles of alcohol, over the counter medication, razor blades and string. At 00:10 on 13 October 2018 the ACU staff called the police and reported Miss Smith as missing and a missing personôs investigation was commenced. At approximately 14:00 on 13 October 2018 two female patients of the ACU saw and spoke to Miss Smith in a wooded area adjacent to the unit shortly before 14:00 and agreed to return there later that afternoon to see her. At approximately 16:45 the same patients returned to the wooded area and found Miss Smith with a plastic bag over her head tied with string. Emergency services were called to the scene and paramedics declared Miss Smith deceased at 17:04 on the 13th October 2018. The juryôs narrative conclusion is set out below: The following made a material contribution to Kimberley Smithôs death:  The care planning and risk management in relation to Kimberley Smithôs use of alcohol and the risks she posed to herself if she left the ward and consumed alcohol were inadequate.  The failure to assess and detain Kimberley Smith under the Mental Health Act on either the 8th or 11th October 2018.  The decision to allow Kimberley Smith to leave the unit on unescorted leave from 11th October 2018.  The nursing staff on duty on the Abraham Cowley Unit on 12th October 2018 did not have sufficient knowledge and understanding of Kimberley Smithôs recent history, alcohol dependency and risk.  The failure of nursing staff to carry out an adequate risk assessment prior to the decision to allow Kimberley Smith to leave the Abraham Cowley Unit at 15:20 on 12th October2018.  The failure of the staff on duty on the Abraham Cowley Unit on the day shift to activate the missing person protocol on 12th October 2018 before the end of their shift.  The failure of the staff on duty on the Abraham Cowley Unit on the night shift to activate the missing person protocol on 12th October 2018 following a telephone call to the ward at approximately 19.30. The following possibly made a material contribution to Kimberley Smithôs death: 4  The decision to reduce the level of observations on Kimberley Smith from every 15 minutes to hourly on 12th October 2018.  A failure by the staff on duty on the Abraham Cowley Unit on 13th October 2018 to make fellow patients aware that Kimberley Smith had not returned to the ward since the previous day.  The information available and provided to the police by the Abraham Cowley Unit nursing staff when she was reported missing on 13th October 2018, including the lack of a completed Missing Persons Pack, was inadequate.  The recording of the information on the Computer Aided Dispatch (ICAD) that was obtained during a phone call from Surrey Police at 01.00 on 13th October 2018 with a witness, was inadequate.  The absence of any warning markers on the Police National Computer or the Surrey Police System NICHE with regards to three recent incidents which had resulted in Kimberley Smith being detained by the police under s.136 of the Mental Health Act. Kimberley Smithôs death was contributed to by Neglect. 5 6 CORONERôS CONCERNS The Coronerôs concerns are as follows: During the inquest the court heard evidence regarding the policies and procedures in place governing requests by informal patients to leave the ACU. The Coroner heard evidence, and accepts, that this is a complex issue in that informal patients are entitled to their liberty whilst at the same time potentially presenting a risk of harming themselves. The Coroner is concerned ì particularly given the complexity of this issue ì that there is no written policy or guidance on it aside from a short paragraph within the Trustôs policy governing leave for detained patients. In particular, there appears to be no clear written policy/procedure on the following: - The carrying out of risk assessments when informal patients request to leave the unit; - The relevance of an informal patient being on intermittent observations when they request to leave the unit; - The processes to follow if informal patients are risk assessed as too high risk to leave the unit; - The risk management plans to put in place when informal patients do leave the unit; - The recording of assessments and decisions relation to requests made by informal patients to leave the unit; - The timeframe for reporting informal patients to the police as missing persons if they fail to return at the agreed time. Whilst the inquest into Miss Smithôs death was concerned with the policies in place for informal patients, the Coroner is not aware of a clear timeframe for reporting detained patients either and consideration should be given to introducing a clear timeframe for detained patients as well. Consideration should also be given to ensuring that all staff are fully trained and competent in any new policies and/or procedures introduced in relation to the matters set out above. 6 During the course of the inquest the court also heard that following Miss Smithôs death SABP carried out a Serious Incident investigation which resulted in the following recommendation, To develop a protocol for managing alcohol detoxification on mental health wards, including specific care plans, minimum monitoring and how to manage leave requests during treatment.ô The court heard that a protocol has been developed to manage the medical aspects of alcohol detoxification but does not cover care plans, minimum monitoring or the management of leave request during treatment. It is of concern that these aspects of the recommendation remain outstanding and consideration should be given to implementing them as a matter of urgency. The MATTER OF CONCERN is: 1. There is no clear written policy/procedure on the following: - The carrying out of risk assessments when informal patients request to leave the unit; - The relevance of an informal patient being on intermittent observations when they request to leave the unit; - The processes to follow if informal patients are risk assessed as too high risk to themselves to leave the unit; - The risk management plans to put in place when informal patients do leave the unit; - The recording of assessments and decisions relation to requests made by informal patients to leave the unit; - The timeframe for reporting informal patients to the police as missing persons if they fail to return at the agreed time. 2. There is no clear written policy/procedure on the following: - The timeframe for reporting detained patients to the police as missing persons if they fail to return at the agreed time. 3. Consideration should be given to introducing written policies in relation to the above matters and to ensuring that all staff are fully trained and competent in relation to these matters. 7 4. Consideration should be given to implementing the recommendation arising from the Serious Incident investigation to develop a protocol for managing alcohol detoxification on mental health wards, including specific care plans, minimum monitoring and how to manage leave requests during treatment. 7 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the people listed in paragraph one above have the power to take such action. 8 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date; I may extend that period on request.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì Samôs mother saw a change in his mood the 7 days before his death which she attributes to the effect of SSRIs. Whilst the precise effect of this medication (Citalopram) on Sam is unknown, it is clear that Sam had never self-harmed previously and his actions were completely out of character. He had started researching schizophrenia on his phone just before his death. Every medicine pack includes a patient information leaflet (PIL), which provides information on using the medicine safely and allows patients to read at their leisure. However, it has been suggested that the úBlack Box Warningù (as developed by the Food and Drug Administration in the USA) would have a more 2 immediate impact and capture some patientôs attention highlighting any risks. The simple and clear message in this specific case would be that there is an increased risk of suicidal thinking in young adults. The benefits of such simple and direct messaging extends to all prescribed medicines and associated major risks."

Commissioner Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) 6th Floor, New Scotland Yard Victoria Embankment London SW1A 2JL","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Metropolitan Police Service officers attended Ms Marchessou on 8 July 2020, after she had been knocked over by the bus. 1. One of the police officers interviewed the bus driver, who told him that Ms Marchessou had stopped when the bus driver sounded his horn, but then had stepped straight in front of the bus, and after she had been hit had got up and run in front of another bus, only being saved when a passer-by grabbed hold of her. The police officer did not pass on this crucial account to the emergency ambulance crew who transported Ms Marchessou to hospital, nor to any of the doctors or nurses at the hospital. 2. Ms Marchessou told the police officers that she had blacked out and could not remember what had happened, then that she thought she had stepped into the road as the result of a panic attack. She also said that she had stepped in front of the bus because she was upset about being denied contact with her children. The police officers did not pass on the crucial information that Ms Marchessou said she had stepped in front of the bus because she was upset about being denied contact with her children, either to the emergency ambulance crew or to the treating doctors or nurses. 3. The two police officers waited with Ms Marchessou at the hospital for well over two hours, but did not at any point during that time radio police control to ask for any enquiries or searches of police systems to be made. Such information could have been potentially extremely helpful to those treating Ms Marchessou. 4. When the police officers returned to the police station, they did make a search themselves and discovered that she had been arrested for domestic violence. However, they did not make a Merlin record of her potential vulnerability and need for assistance. 3 5. I was provided with a statement from one of the two police officers in advance of the inquest and I called him to give oral evidence on 25 November 2020. When I put to him the sub optimal nature of the way that he had dealt with the incident on 8 July 2020, he did not appear to have undertaken any reflection on this in the intervening four and a half months, nor in the witness box. If there was any error in not passing on information, he attributed this error to his colleague. He did not consider that he had failed to apply a healthy degree of scepticism to Ms Marchessouôs version of events, particularly in the light of the bus driverôs description. He reiterated the view he had formed on the day, that Agn√®s Marchessou being hit by a bus was purely an accident. The police officer defended all of his actions robustly. I could not see that he had learnt anything as a result of these events or that anything about his practice would change in the future. 6. The police officer giving evidence was aware of the view of the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) regarding the failure to create a Merlin, expressed in its report on the police handling of the incident on 8 July, but he seemed very confused about how that should work in practice. If he is confused, even after police have taken him through the DPS report, then other police officers may also be confused."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì Sgt Paul Hills was an Royal Air Force Firefighter Trainer, had served over 20 years and had completed two tours of duty in Afghanistan. He experienced mental health problems and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and received treatment from DCMH Woolwich a three hour round trip from his home. His treatment continued during the COVID-19 pandemic. 1. No risk assessment was completed on the issue of moving mental health appointments to virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic and how patients could be kept safe in the event of deterioration in his mental health. There was no plan in place for patients that required urgent assessment/review due to deterioration in their mental health. 2. Care plan had not been updated since October 2019 and his risk assessment remained the same even when the scores changed and there was evidence of escalating risk behaviour. 3. Risk issues were not shared with the family even though Sgt Hills was in lockdown with them and there were no discussions regarding sharing of information. He disclosed his dry runs of self-strangulation on 28th February and 16th April and his withdrawal/isolation from his family who had been very supportive of him. On 22nd April he disclosed he was looking for a rafter to harm himself from and there was an overreliance on his family as a protective factor in the absence of this knowledge being shared with them. 4. His risk assessment was not up-to-date and his disclosures during April were not documented. 5. Sgt Hills was advised not to drive with his wife and children in the car when he disclosed strong thoughts to drive head long into oncoming traffic. This advice would not have protected Sgt Hills or other road users. 6. Evidence was heard during the inquest that RAF Manston was being decommissioned and this impacted on the treatment available locally for Sgt Hills and impacted on communications with the DCMH and the sharing of relevant information."

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì During oral evidence, I was advised that when an onwards internal referral is made to another clinician within the Priory Group which is then declined this is not communicated directly to the patient if the treatment is funded by way of insurance cover. In those cases a notification would be provided to the insurers or the policyholder and then the Priory Group would not have any further contact with the patient. As such, patients that are considered to be higher risk by the clinician at initial assessment may not therefore have the opportunity to imminently consider alternative sources of treatment or receive any advice as to safety netting in the interim as this information is not being provided by clinicians to the patient. From the evidence that I heard it would be reliant on their insurers or corporate policy holders (who may well not be clinicians) to make contact with the patients to inform them of this during which time their health may have further declined or their risk increased.

Mr , Assistant Chief Constable, Devon & Cornwall Constabulary","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. May I please direct your attention to pages 21-23 of the attached summing up. ViST forms. These generate a lot of data about potentially vulnerable individuals. I consider deaths may be prevented in the future where that data could be appropriately shared with partner agencies. I have in mind, in particular, Cornwall Partnership Foundation Trust and Kernow Clinical Commissioning Group (on behalf of GPs.) I recognise there is a need to limit or prioritise the data shared so that it is manageable and targeted to the most vulnerable and/or those at greatest risk of harm or self-harm. I further recognise that there may well be legitimate concerns about data protection. I was told this may be overcome where a particular individual consents to the sharing of data. Where someone refuses to consent, however, I accept sharing may be more problematic and legal advice may be required. 2 Information Classification: CONTROLLED Information Classification: CONTROLLED Custody Access to CJLDT Assessments and Consideration of Ramifications of Imposing Bail Conditions on Vulnerable Individuals. At his assessment by CJLDT in May 2018, it had been recognised that was a strong protective factor keeping Darrell from harming himself. After his release from custody in July 2018, a bail condition was (correctly) imposed that he was not to contact his wife. This had the unintended consequence of removing that strong protective factor. In the event those in custody had known of the assessment in the CJLDT records, that may have had an influence on assessing Darrellôs risk to himself at the point of release. It may have led to a request to an HCP or CPFT to re-assess Darrellôs risk to himself. It may be that the standard questions completed by custody sergeants could be amended to require an Officer to review or have reviewed any assessment in CJLDT prior to the imposition of a bail condition on a vulnerable individual and his release from custody."

Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) It was the evidence of the author of the EPUT Root Cause Analysis Investigation Report, , that whilst all the other EPUT teams that came into contact with Mr King, such as the Mental Health Liaison Team and the Street Triage Team, used the same software called Mobius with which to record, access and share important information and developments regarding Mr King, one Team, namely the Health and Justice Team did not use this software and instead used software that was incapable of being accessed by the other teams. A consequence of this was that the other teams were wholly unaware of crises and other important information regarding Mr Kingôs mental health that were known to the Health and Justice Team. (2) Whilst it was the view of the RCA author that in Mr Kingôs case such an obstacle to the sharing / accessing of important information did not have a direct bearing on the outcome for Mr King, she did expressly state, and I share this concern, that there is the potential for the wellbeing and lives of other individuals to be jeopardised where important information and / or crises are known to and recorded by the Health and Justice Team but unknown to all the other relevant Teams. There is the potential for the risk of harm to self and others, including death, to be inaccurately assessed and managed where the assessor does not have access to the full picture. (3) The RCA author was not aware as to why the Health and Justice Team had different software to Mobius or why it was not capable of integration with Mobius, but she felt, and I agree, that action should be taken, if it has not already happened, to explore this issue and to implement a solution."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you; the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows. ì In evidence it was heard that Piotr had not received his depotô medication for some time and was clearly suffering from a psychotic episode at the time of his assessment at the Accident and Emergency department of the West Suffolk Hospital on the 16th December 2019 Piotr told staff he was not actively suicidal at that point in time, and although the staff were concerned about his presentation, under mental health law least restrictive principles, they did not believe the powers of detention under the Mental Health Act were applicable. That said, it was also clear from the evidence that the mental health personnel who saw Piotr wanted to immediately admit him as an informal patient. It was also clear that when Piotr attended hospital on the 16th December 2019, he too wanted to be immediately admitted as an informal patient. As a result, staff tried to locate a bed for Piotr so he could be admitted as all involved wished. However, it was identified that there were no beds available in Suffolk, or anywhere else in the country at the time. Different options of keeping Piotr in the hospital were explored but none were viable. As such, Piotr was prescribed medication to reduce his immediate anxiety and sent home with a friend, with instructions to return if his symptoms deteriorated. Piotr took his own life the next morning before he could be returned to hospital. Had a bed been available and Piotr had been admitted as he and medical staff had wished on the evening of the 16th December 2019, his death would not have occurred. I am therefore concerned in relation to the overall bed capacity for those patients like Piotr seeking informal admission. In addition, I am concerned about the provisions to temporarily house a patient wishing informal admission in the circumstances that a bed is not immediately available."

The prescribing consultant did not give Mr Scott-Brown a Trust information sheet about Lamotrigine and a Patient Information Leaflet about Lamotrigine from the drug manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline. It was common ground that the consultant should have done so. Both documents record as a side effect of using Lamotrigine a risk that the patient may begin to experience thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Mr Scott-Brown was never given that information. The consultant gave evidence that he was not aware of that particular side effect of Lamotrigine, and that his prescribing practice was informed by the British National Formulary and The Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines. Neither the online BNF viewable via the NICE website nor the 10th Edition of The Maudsley Guidelines (to which the court was referred) refer to that side effect in their respective entries for Lamotrigine. Subsequent to the conclusion of the Inquest, I have learned from the Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust that when Mr Scott-Brown was prescribed Lamotrigine, the then current edition of the Maudsley Guidelines was the 13th Edition. The Inquest heard no evidence about the 13th Edition of the Maudsley Guidelines and information therein concerning Lamotrigine. Quite apart from any issue regarding the consultantís knowledge about Lamotrigine (and the existence of the 13th Edition of the Maudsley Guidelines) and his not having given Mr Scott-Brown the Trustís prepared information about the drug and its side effects, I am concerned that two obviously reputable sources of pharmacological information are apparently silent, or have been silent, on a potentially significant side effect of this particular drug. From a lay perspective, there is apparent potential for harm to patients depending upon which resources a prescriber consults before prescribing Lamotrigine. That potential for harm might be ameliorated were the advice about Lamotrigine consistent across all such resources."

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) The Joint Commissioning Panel for Mental Healthôs Guidance for Commissioners of Community Specialist Mental Health Services expresses an expectation that there would be more than one clinical psychologist for each Community Mental Health Team, given that clinical psychologists are referred to in the plural within discussions of an appropriate staff team for CMHTs whereas, for example, consultant psychiatrists are referred to in the singular. (2) CMHTs in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire have a commissioned establishment of, at most, one clinical psychologist per team, with some teams having only a part time clinical psychologist post.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you On the evidence heard at inquest, it appears when a patient is admitted to a bed within a Mental Health Trust out of their normal locality (in this case County Durham, when the patient lived in London) there was no national policy to co-ordinate the transfer of patients back to their 'Home' area. It appears there was no agreed escalation policy when a bed could not be obtained and no agreed process to 'apply' for a bed in another Trust area. It is of concern as the arrangements at the present time seem to be ad Hoc in nature and may as such create delay in any transfer of patients."

Just before he was deported he confirmed he would kill himself if he was deported. He was provided with 1:1 constant watch and was successfully deported. When he re-entered the UK on 30/01/19 he was seen by a member of the immigration compliance and enforcement team who completed paperwork for the national asylum accommodation unit who in turn completed a service commission form requesting initial accommodation. The service commission form recorded that he had urgent medical needs and was a safeguarding concern however no detail was provided. Neither G4S nor Urban housing services requested any further details. A system needs to be put in place to ensure organisations provide sufficient details for providers to understand the nature of safeguarding concerns and health care matters. If there are GDPR concerns these could easily be addressed by a consent form at the time the person is first seen. 2. The events on 29/10/18 when he made a threat to kill himself were not logged with the safeguarding hub as he was about to be deported. There needs to be a system to ensure all safeguarding matters are logged regardless of where the person is in the system

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it 3 is my statutory duty to report to you. During the inquest, evidence was heard that: 1. Nursing staff and Health Care Assistants on Westleigh Ward at Atherleigh Park Hospital were carrying out (and continue to carry out) observations of patients at precise intervals (for example, if a patient is on half-hourly observations, staff explained that they would aim to carry out observations at 10.00 am, 10.30 a.m., 11 am etc.). Further, all records showed that the timings of observations were at precise intervals. This is not in accordance with the Trustôs policy of observations (which confirms that observations should be irregular but within the (e.g. 30 minute) window. The reason for this policy is clearly to avoid a situation whereby a patient can predict when they will next be observed (and offer an opportunity for the patient to take action to harm herself during that period of time). 2. The Deputy Ward Manager on Westleigh Ward at Atherleigh Park Hospital confirmed that she did not and still does not check that observations by staff are being carried out in accordance with the Trust policy, despite accepting that this was her role when the nurse in charge of a shift. Further, the Deputy Manager of Westleigh Ward did not understand the Policy and thought that observations were to be carried out at regular intervals (as referred to above). 3. The Trust carried out an investigation following the death of Lauren. It was of concern that the lead investigator (who gave evidence at the inquest) did not understand the Observation Policy and suggested that observations should be carried out at irregular intervals (which was correct) but then gave an example of 10 minute observations being carried out at: 10 am, 10.08 am, 10.20 am (which is clearly not in accordance with the Policy). The interval should never exceed the 10 minute period (and there is 12 minutes between 10.08 am and 10.20 am). 4. There were examples in the records of nursing staff putting in entries 24 hours after the event had occurred. Whilst it is accepted that nursing staff may, on occasion, need to wait some time before marking an entry into the clinical record, a period of 24 hours when dealing with patients at risk of self-harm and suicide means that relevant information is potentially not available to staff on the next shift."

This was due to tho fact that there were no weekY tutorials with personal tutors, There were lectures each week, for all School of Mathematics students however, allendance was not monitored and was not mandatory. Therefore, sometimes you only notice after exams if a student Is really stugging, úThe university accepted that after this they then reach a dead end, where they believe a student's unwel but they have no other means of addressing It Students can be required to withdraw ffom the universty with no face to face Contact with any member ofthe University stat The University detalles how they had changed their policies to adress issues highighted, but accepted that without. adequate monitoring measures, mandatory attendance to tutorial and mandatory Homework assignments, and In the absence of sanctions for non-atlendance of tutorials or fling to hand in homework assignments, the policies may nat bit.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you On the evidence heard at inquest, it appears when a patient is admitted to a bed within a Mental Health Trust out of their normal locality (in this case County Durham, when the patient lived in London) there was no national policy to co-ordinate the transfer of patients back to their 'Home' area. It appears there was no agreed escalation policy when a bed could not be obtained and no agreed process to 'apply' for a bed in another Trust area.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. Mr Ashleyôs Care and Treatment Plan was not updated when his mental health deteriorated. 2. Staff were not recording interactions with Mr Ashley in the CareNotes system and often emails were not copied into these notes. Therefore there was a lack of compilation of key information relating to Mr Ashley. 3. There was no system in place for Lead Practioners to be notified of an important entry in a patientôs CareNotes where action was required. 4. Mr Ashley had not been seen by a Psychiatrist for over a year and there was no evidence that the deterioration of his mental health (and his non compliance with his medication) had been reviewed by the professionals weekly team meetings. 5. The Inquest identified that there was a discrepanciy in the Trustôs own Policies as to when a Risk Assesment should be reviewed. 6. Save for the duty scheme there appears to be no procedure in place for another practictioner to cover a Lead Practictionerôs case load or any formal handover when they are on leave. Therefore there was no single person who has uptodate knowledge of a patient who may be in need or whose mental health was deteriorating. 7. The Inquest heard evidence that the Liasion Mental Health Team at the Hosptial did not make use of patientôs Care and Support Plans or Central Risk Assessment. 8. The was no clear procedure for GPs to be updated by Care Coordinators with details of a patientôs current treatment plan if it had been changed. This was particulary important where there was no regular assessments by a Psychiatrist who would in the normal course of events be providing such updates.

ADAPT, Bexley Locality Community Mental Health Team, Erith Centre","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) The findings of the internal investigation by Oxleas NHS were that the assessment undertaken by the Community Mental Health Nurse did not illicit sufficient information to enable the multidisciplinary team to properly review Mr Jenkinsô mental health. Despite this the multi-disciplinary team proceeded with a review and decided that he did not have a mental health condition, without seeking a further assessment (2) The Community Mental Health Nurse did not document her formulation or impression. The plan moving forward was not robust and did not explore protective factors or minimisation of harm and there was an over-reliance on alcohol and drug use as the cause of his suicidal ideation. There appeared to be no proforma of questions to ask. (3) As a direct consequence of the limited information gathering Billy Jenkins was not properly assessed and it was not known whether he had a mental health diagnosis which required treatment. (4) It was not known whether as a result of this death there had been any lessons learned by the teams involved in care and treatment of Billy Jenkins, or whether there had been any training or support requirements identified for the Community Mental Health Nurse."

CORONER I am Geraint Williams HM Assistant Coroner, for the coroner area of South Wales Central. 2. CORONERôS LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3. INVESTIGATION and INQUEST On 26th October 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of IAN JAMES WEEKS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11th March 2020. The medical cause of death provided was: 1(a) Pressure on the neck consistent with hanging; 2. Synthetic cannabinoid use. The Coronerôs conclusion at the end of the Inquest was: A case of suicide 4. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH These were recorded as:- Ian Weeks was remanded into custody at HMP Cardiff on the 7th August 2017. He was assessed by prison and healthcare staff as not being at risk of self- harming or suicide. Sometime between 20.20 on the 20th of October and the 21st of October whilst alone in his cell , Cell 13, 2nd floor, F-wing believing that personal relationships had recently broken down he made a ligature from the bed sheet and hung himself from the shower rail in his cell. 5. CORONERôS CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) Although it was recorded on System 1 that Mr Weeks had recently attempted suicide in another prison shortly before his admission to HMP Cardiff no member of Healthcare staff checked the medical records and further that although the GP records which were sent to the prison confirmed that Mr Weeks was prescribed anti-depressants in the community no member of Healthcare staff noticed this and as a consequence Mr Weeks was not given anti-depressants in HMP Cardiff. The Healthcare witnesses, including the Head of Healthcare, indicated that a red flag for suicide or self-harm would be of great value for staff who because of insufficient staff and a heavy workload did not have time to review the System 1 record in any or any sufficient detail. Further it was considered that all System 1 records should be reviewed when an individual is admitted into the prison and that there should be in place a process for doing so. 6. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8 May 2020. I, the Coroner, may extend the period upon request. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8. COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the family who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 12th March 2020 SIGNED: Geraint Williams Assistant Coroner for South Wales Central","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Rebecca had died at St George's Hospital on 4 May 2018, folowing an aspirin overdose taken whilst detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act a Sprngfels Hospital. She was 39 years old atthe ime of her death The Jury made the following findings: Medical Cause of Death 1 (a) Malti-organ failure (b) Salicylate poisoning - II Mixed personality disorder, Eating disorder non-specified, Significant self- arm How, when, where and in what circumstances Rebecca came by her death: Rebecca Hursey ded on 4/572018 at 00:54 at CITU St George's Hospital of mult-organ faire and saloyiate poisoning, caused by a sof administered overdose of aspirin, which was discovered at approx. 5:18 am on 35/20%8, Atthe te of her death she was diagnosed with mbxed and other personality disorders, eating isorder non specied, chronic microcyse anaemia and significant sel-harm, She was receiving care on the Avalon Ward which is an eating disorder unt at Springfield Hospital, and she was subject to Sec 3 of the Mental Heath Act. She was suffering with severe and enduring mental lines. The overdose occurred while Rebecca was under level 3 observation. Overnight observations between 2/5/2018 and 3182018 were not recorded in ine withthe Observation and Engagement policy Observations and searches were unable to mitgate her risk of self-harm and suicide, Exionsve and so far, unsuccessful searches had been undertaken for altemative placements fo provide her wth required treatment and to more safely manage her risk of Settharm An úimpasseù in treatment for har dlagnoss had arisen but dayto-day toatment continued, Rebecca's tness was euch tha her state of mind was very delicately balanced: she was easily and deeply distressed by clinical treatments and by proposed changes to her suppor arrangements, Proceeding her death these mattrs impacted her state of min: Treatment wih on infusion under restraint Impending loss of her psychotherapist.

Hee overal high risk of suicidality and seltnarm, In the time leading up to her death, Avalon was an inappropriate placement for Rebecca to provise eatment consistent with her dagnoss. Avalon was an inappropriate place to manage her high sk of suicidality and se-harm Conclusion ofthe Jury as to the death: Rebecca Jane Hursey took her own life whilst suffering with severe and enduring, mental illness. Extensive evidence was taken court ln summary, of relevance to Wis report On the day that Rebecca is thought to have taken the overdose that tok her life she hhad been recognised by the psychologist as stongly and actively suicidal. This was recorded in the notes, but not passed on verbaly by him tothe nurse in charge, Handover was verbal between shifts and this increased suicidal sk was not appreciated by the allocated nurse such that extra support for Rebecca was not considered atthe materia time. Rebecca had been a patent on Avalon from June 2013. Discharge was considered from early 2014 but no sultableallemative placement was found for her prior to her death in May 2018. Her complexity and suicidality was well documented from eary on in her psychiatric cae, as far back as 2002 when she was ving in Leicester, but withthe lack of somewhere suitable to go, Avalon was leftn an untenable postion of having no choice but to provide in-patient care for Rebecca, when it was clearly recognised that the war√© could not manage her sucialiy, nor provide suitable treatment for her. She had been referred to Avalon from Leicester based services, but they found no placement intel area, where she sil had a residential address, for her to return to Concerns of the Coroner: 1. That taf handovers be led by examination ofthe cinical record such that recent progress can be assessed especially in relation to risk management and care plans amended accordingy. 2, That practitoners who recognise inctease in suicidal sk of a patient should pass ths on verbally to the nurse on charge of the ward or the nurse located tothe patient. 3. That NHS England considera system of introducing deadtines for aferatve placements tobe found for such patients, so that they must be found in a timely fashion. 4. That placements for patients with high risk of selt-narm, such as Rebecca _2r0 prioritised such that safer placements are found within a timely fashion. '5.

As HMP Liverpool were present throughout this investigation, the court understands that these training issues are being resolved locally. However this is a national issue and It is important that not only should HMPPS hold training records for those employed in the prison service but that each individual should have a personal training record. It would help if training certificates with expiry dates were issued after all courses with a copy being given to attendees and the record being held by the prison service. This would ensure all officers with current training could work across the prison estate, adding resilience."

Indeed , the Clinical Lead for the Time to Talk service in the North Area, of gave evidence at Gemma Azharís inquest and informed me that in her view, the service ìdid not get it rightî. She stated that given that the TTT service had cancelled Ms Azharës apppointment twice, it would have been preferable if there had been attempts made to find her an alternative therapist on 30 September 2019 and, if none was available, for a duty worker to have spoken to Gemma Azhar before she was discharged from the service in order to understand: the reasons for her now declining a third appointment; her current mental state and, if appropriate, seek to engage her and assess her present risk. informed me that it was now the ëformalí position that this should happen after a second cancellation by the service. However, it is a matter of concern to me that staff working in the North area (Horsham, Crawley and Mid Sussex) have only been notified of this ëformal positioní by an email sent in or around December 2019. This procedure is not part of any written policy or protocol or induction training and therefore new staff in the North area would only learn of the procedure by word of mouth. Furthermore, was not aware whether or not a similar instruction had been given to the Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trustís staff working for the TTT service in other areas."

The HBTT was the only means by which Samantha could be monitored other than an admission and satisfy the RAID pracitoners concerns, Samantha was accepted by the HTT on the thd time of asking. This appears tobe because the person receiving the request was prepared fo see Samana, a person rather than be restricted by protocol and by the fat that the RAID practioner was 0 concerned about Samantha that she was going io review Samantha within the RAID processes, which was not part fits remit. Without monitoring would not have been possible to prescribe olanzapine. There is clearly lacuna inthe provision of supervision and monterng of patients who are not deemed admissibie, voluniarly or by section between the RAID and HTT services.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) The findings of the internal investigation by Oxleas NHS were that the assessment undertaken by the Community Mental Health Nurse did not illicit sufficient information to enable the multidisciplinary team to properly review Mr Jenkinsô mental health. Despite this the multi-disciplinary team proceeded with a review and decided that he did not have a mental health condition, without seeking a further assessment (2) The Community Mental Health Nurse did not document her formulation or impression. The plan moving forward was not robust and did not explore protective factors or minimisation of harm and there was an over-reliance on alcohol and drug use as the cause of his suicidal ideation. There appeared to be no proforma of questions to ask. (3) As a direct consequence of the limited information gathering Billy Jenkins was not properly assessed and it was not known whether he had a mental health diagnosis which required treatment. (4) It was not known whether as a result of this death there had been any lessons learned by the teams involved in care and treatment of Billy Jenkins, or whether there had been any training or support requirements identified for the Community Mental Health Nurse."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) The Inquest focused upon the response of the emergency services ê SWP, WAST & CTMUHB Mental Health Nurse, to the earlier suicidal episode. Evidence was received from amongst others, of SWP, ì paramedic from WAST & Mental Health Nurse, regarding their involvement with DL. gave evidence as to his interpretation of s136 Mental Health Act 1983(MHA). In particular, whether he believed that the power to remove DL arose in the particular circumstances he was presented with on the evening of 28.3.19. In summary, his interpretation of s136 was that, even if he had been satisfied that DL was suffering from a mental disorder & in immediate need of care, or control, the power to detain would not have been available to him, due to the exclusion in s136(1A). His interpretation of that subêsection was that as DL had paid for the hotel room in which she was staying, that was a room in which she was living. Regard was had during the Inquest as to the Department of Health Guidance to the changes to the MHA 1983, published in October 2017. No specific guidance as to the classification of a hotel room for the purposes of whether that falls within the exception in s136 (1A) is provided. Whilst it is accepted, both by myself, & in the Guidance, as above, that there will always be some degree of discretion for a police officer to exercise in relation to the interpretation of whether a person is living in a hotel room, the evidence here was that DL had booked into the room for one night & had no more than a bare licence to occupy it (which would contrast with, for example, an individual or family temporarily housed in a hotel room by a local authority, or a care home resident occupying indefinitely a room in a care home). Hence, based upon the evidence I received, and my interpretation (in these particular circumstances) of whether a hotel room came within s136 (1A) MHA, I found it likely that did have the power to remove DL to a place of safety My concern is that faced with a similar situation (albeit in circumstances were the officer did consider a person was suffering from mental disorder and requiring of immediate care, or control), an officer may reach the same conclusion as determine the power to remove did not exist, and this may lead to a risk of death to that individual. I would emphasise that whilst I interpreted s136 MHA as likely to afford the power to remove DL on the night in question, I found his assessment of DL to be a reasonable one, and that the grounds to remove her did not exist as she was not in immediate need of care, or control. (2) I consider that it is necessary for the police to consider their interpretation of whether a hotel room falls within the exception provided for by s136 (1A) MHA, and to provide clear guidance, and instruction to officers faced with exercising their powers under s136 MHA in circumstances were an individual presents with suffering from mental disorder, is requiring of immediate care or control and at that time is located in a hotel room."

From 4ù October 2018, Daniel Akam expressed that he was receiving threats from other inmates, and was suffering acute anxiety as a result. An ACCT was opened, and he was subsequently moved to a different wing on 8"" October 2018. 3 Throo days prior to his death on 10 October 2018, he made superficial cus to his wrists and forehead, at which point he was put onto twice hourly ACCT observations. This frequency was to Continue until further amendment, save 2 further stipulation was added following a third and final ACCT review the day before his death, on 12"" October 2018, that no observation should be more than 35 minutes after the preceding observation. 4. Howover, this third ACCT review only lasted for botwoen 5-7 minutes, no member of health care was present, and the assessment wrongly concluded that Daniel Akam posed a risk of harm to others rather than to himsetf. This was contrary to all his prison records, with which staff conducting the review had not sufficiently familiarised themselves. Furthermore, his worsened mental state was not sufficiently conveyed to health care post review [The jury concluded thatthe inadequacy ofthis third and {inal ACCT review possibly contributed to death. 5, Daniol Akam was last seen alive on an ACCT observation at approximately 8:45am on 13% October 2018. 6. The next ACCT observation due at approximatoly 9:1519:20a.m. was not performed (Although it was left as possibly contributory, the jury did not find that this factor possibly contributed to death. 7. Daniel Akam was found unresponsive on the floor of his prison cell with a rope ligature around his neck at 8:4Sa.m; and declared doceased at 10:30a.m. 8. He was no longer attached to the ligature upon his discovery, and it was not possible, then or subsequently, to identify the ligature point in the call; nor how he was able to have a rope in his cell at a time when he was vulnorable to self-harm. CORONER'S CONCERNS: | During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~ allure to cary out ACCT observations recorded in the ACCT log (1) CCTV evidence in the inquest established that 18 observations on Mr Akam were not carried out (2) The same 18 missed observations were recorded in the ACCT document as having been carried out, when they had not been. (3) Five different prison officers purportedly signed various of these entries. (4) Whilst the above missed observations occurred 24 hours priorto Daniel Akam's death and were not contributory, the purpose of | ACCT observations is to reduce the risk of suicide and self- harm in 2 vulnerable prisoner. If necessary observations are missed, the risk of suicide and self-harm amongst vulnerable prisoners will kely increase. | | (6) The fact that the five separate officers did not carry out observations, when they recorded that they did, indicates that the problem is systemic. | | ACCT training for prison officers (6) In addition, the evidence revealed that the prison officers did not appear to know what their own obligations and responsibilities were in relation to the ACCT procedure and processes. The general evidential picture was that of inadequate ACCT training for officers, who universally indicated that it would be helpful to have refresher training, (7) Unless adequate and repeated ACCT training is provided for all officers, particulary for those junior and more inexperienced officers, the lives of vulnerable prisoners will not be | safeguarded in accordance with the purpose of the ACCT i procedure.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. As | have stated | did not find that the evidence established a causal or contributory connection between the unregulated placement and Jacob's death, | found this to be so on the applicable civil law test, the balance of probabilities. However in my summing-up | did express my serious concems that Jacob had been placed in an unregulated placement despite his history, needs, and risks. Evidence was given at the inquest hearing by two former employees at the placement that they had no prior experience of working with young people (indeed no experience of working in any form of care-related work) and were left in charge of the unit where Jacob was placed after a very short period of commencing employment (one former staff member said that he had only completed two shadowing sessions before being asked to be in sole charge of the unit overnight). The evidence of the responsible local authority was that it had not sought evidence from the placement provider as to staff competency and training, or that sultable policies and procedures were in place; it effectively accepted the assurances of the provider, úThe local authority stated that it now has systems providing for greater scrutiny and diligence - but itô was explained that where residentialsupported provision is solely for young people aged 16 to 18 that provision falls outside or the statutory regime of inspection. and regulatory compliance as enforced by Ofsted. My understanding is that the issue of unregulated placements for 16 to 18 year olds has been widely highlighted as a cause for concem but the evidence of a senior local authority manager at inquest was that she was unaware of any plans nationally to address the issue despite concems having been very widely raised. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: - 1 Vulnerable young people, aged 16 to 18, are being placed in unregulated placements. Any young person under the age of 18 placed in an unregulated placement is likely to have very significant vulnerabilities, and itis likely that young people with complex needs and at significant risk are being placed in such placements; indeed this was the case for Jacob. As the placements are unregulated there are no statutory regulations to comply with relating to competency and appropriate | policies and procedures by the provider and there is no regulatory | body to check and assess those providers. This is clearly a very concerning situation given the very high level needs that some of the young people will have. The lack of statutory regulation then places an onus on local authorities to check that a provider is competent and safe. Whilst in making individual placements it must be the duty of a local authority to satisfy itself as best as it is able that placements are safeô, glven the pressures on local authorities it cannot be the case that they are in a position to mirror the type and nature of inspection and oversight that might be provided by @ regulator such as Ofsted. In view of the points made above the lack of statutory regulation is placing vulnerable young people at risk, and there is a realistic possibilty that deaths may occur. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you have the power to take such action.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you On the evidence heard at inquest, it appears when a patient is admitted to a bed within a Mental Health Trust out of their normal locality (in this case County Durham, when the patient lived in London) there was no national policy to co-ordinate the transfer of patients back to their 'Home' area. It appears there was no agreed escalation policy when a bed could not be obtained and no agreed process to 'apply' for a bed in another Trust area. It is of concern as the arrangements at the present time seem to be ad Hoc in nature and may as such create delay in any transfer of patients."

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. In the course of hearing an inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court on 9/10/19 into the death of Julius Jake Little, evidence was considered in relation to available support services offered to undergraduates at UAL who have a history of mental health problems. The Dean of Students at UAL , gave 3 evidence that applicants to UAL make an online application to the admissions organisation UCAS. The application invites them to disclose any history they have of mental health problems, upon being accepted on a course of study this information is provided to the admitting university. indicated that the mental health disclosure information is used to target students that may require support, and at UAL emails are sent to undergraduates, inviting them to register with the university's support services. Regrettably, it would appear that of UAL's cohort of students that disclosed mental health problems to UCAS, only 66% of undergraduates responded to the email invitation offering mental health support. The remaining 33%, a total of some 200 students, did not respond to the offer. I asked whether the identity of students who had made a mental health disclosure in their UCAS application was communicated to tutors and halls of residence staff at the university. I was informed that this information was not so disseminated as it would be breach of data protection legislation, this appears to be a missed opportunity. I cannot suggest a solution to this problem, however it does appear to be a lost opportunity to secure this valuable information but not to utilise it effectively."

In this case the deceased underwent further assessments therefore the effects of this situation were reduced. I am concerned however that in other cases this could result in situations where a patientôs own concerns are not addressed or taken into consideration when conducting an assessment that could lead to an assessment based on incomplete information and result in another patient taking their own life. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. The gateway assessors did not have full access to the notes relating to the review and subsequent concerns that triggered the gateway assessment.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur Unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. î The inquest was told that the provision of mental health services post 16 varies widely across the country. In some areas there is a CAMHS 16-25 mental health service provision similar to the national 16 and under service whereas in other areas there a limited transition service or move back to primary care for re-referral to adult services. The inquest was told that this creates a cliff edge high risk situation for adolescents. The reason for the difference was resources and decisions taken by CCGs. The inquest was told that itis important for autism to be diagnosed 2s erly 2s possible so that appropriate support can be putin place. Early diagnosis was impacted by a national picture of long waiting lists for ADOS assessments. In Stockport there was approximately a 6 month waiting list for assessment. This was against a national picture of 12-24 month waits in some areas. During the inquest evidence was heard that acceleration ahead of a chronological schoo! age might cause relatively few difficulties in peer relationships up to about year 9 but post that as children entered adolescence it could become a significant issue impacting a child's mental health and ability to cope. Where it did happen, there needed to be an understanding by schools of the risks and early signs indicating a need for additional support to try to reduce the likelihood of self-harming behaviours and the potential need for additional support. The inquest heard that Oliver had found the autism label and the label of isabiliy that was attached to it vey dificult to accept as time went on. There was evidence that particularly with high achieving children with autism the idea that they had a disability created additional challenge.

Birmingham Womenôs and Childrenôs NHS Foundation Trust 4. Priory Group of Hospitals,During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. There was a delay in organising the assessment of Mr Dundhal when he was detained on S5(2) of the Mental Health Act on 11/04/19. The evidence confirmed there appeared to be confusion as to who was to undertake the assessment between Walsall MBC and Birmingham City Council. In addition there was a lack of resources to enable the assessment to be carried out in a timely manner. This meant the assessment was carried out just a few hours before the time period for the S5(2) was to expire. 2. Evidence at the inquest from the approved Mental health practitioner confirmed that key information and documentation were either unavailable and/or not asked for during the mental health act assessment on 14/04/19. I was unable to confirm which at the inquest. This meant the true nature of Mr Dundhalôs long term condition was not known and the assessors were unable to see the úbigger pictureù. The delay in arranging the assessment contributed to the lack of available information. 3. When Mr Dundhal was admitted to hospital on 15/03/19 he was placed on S2 of the Mental Health Act when his clinical team had specifically recommended he be placed on S3. No explanation was available for this. Evidence at the inquest suggested this was a decision made by the Approved Mental health practitioner from Birmingham City Council. Consideration needs to given as to why a S3 was not put in place in accordance with the recommendation. 4. Walsall MBC has failed to undertake an internal investigation into the delays and resources concerns during the assessment in April 19. They have also failed to engage with other agencies to ensure lessons are learnt. It is essential in complex cases like this that all agencies work together after a tragedy to ensure lessons are learnt to protect others.

Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP, Secretary of State for Health","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: During almost 40 years sitting as a Coroner, Senior Coroner and now Assistant Coroner, I have heard numerous inquests where had there been communication between the doctors, nurses and therapists caring for patients with mental health issues, and the close relatives of those patients, many issues might have been explained and lives saved. The reason given in the present case, as in so many others, is that of patient 2 confidentiality. Whilst the medical authorities are usually right in their interpretation, one wonders whether some form of enquiry/commission might be established to review the law on confidentiality and especially where it interfaces with those patients who have capacityô but where their relatives have valuable information which could help doctors decide on best care and treatment."

No approved Mental Health practitioner was available to make the Mental Health Act assessment of Mr Carlon on 14/11/18. I was told this was an ongoing problem and was delaying assessments. 2. When Mr Carlon was found safe and well at home WMP did not advise BSMHT. This was a missed opportunity for Mental health to reêengage with Mr Carlon and make a further assessment of his condition.

I heard evidence at the inquest that this call was graded incorrectly. It should have been graded as a P2 call with a response time within 60minutes. I also heard evidence to confirm that the large number of P1 calls that evening meant that even if the call had been correctly graded it would not have been answered as all available resources were required for the P1 calls (15 minutes response). The evidence confirmed that nearly all the P2 and P3 calls went unanswered that night. This raises a serious concern about the amount of resources available to West Midlands Police.

The investigation concluded on the 2% July 2019 and the conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a) Traumatic brain injury 4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH | Inher first year at university, Hannah Bharaj had anxiety and depression, There was an early opportunity o address her mental health when she | did seek help on one occasion in her first year. She found the focus on | her academic performance rather than her difficulties adjusting to her | grief unhelpful and did not seek further help that academic year. | From May 2017, she began to use withholding food from herself to help | her manage and provide a feeling of control. By September 2017 she had | significantly deteriorated and sought further help from the University and | GP. The GP identified it was likely she had an eating disorder. Hannah | took a leave of absence from University and retumed home, She was | seen by the Bolton Eating Disorder Team, she was diagnosed as having | atypical anorexia and depression. Attempts to treat her in the community were unsuccessful and her BMI was 13.6 kgim2 by 4 December 2017. On the 5 December 2017, she was admitted to the Eating Disorder Unit | (EDU). She was a patient there until her discharge on the 22% May 2018 when her BM was 17.3 kg/m2. Formal psychology sessions had not started until 23 March 2018 because the Eating Disorder Unit did not have a psychologist in post. Throughout her time in EDU Hannah expressed suicidal ideation which fluctuated. On the 22% May 2018, she was discharged into the community. No discharge plan was sent o the GP. On the 25"" May 2018 a close family member died. At the final psychology appointment on the 29"" May 2018, she described specific methods she had considered to end her life including overdose. The barrier to that being insufficient medication. Her mental health had clearly deteriorated and her suicidal ideation increased. There was a failure to communicate the detail ofthis to her family or the prescribing GP. This probably contributed to Hannah taking, on the 31"" May 2018, a large overdose of ther medication prescribed by her GP who had not been notified of her suicide risk by the Eating Disorder Unit or been asked by the EDU to Prescribe in a way that would reduce risk. | Hannah was assessed by the RAID team, following the refusal of the Eating Disorder Unit Team to accept her back. A decision was made to place Hannah in an adult acute psychiatric bed. local NHS bed was not available and she was placed at The Priory in Cheadle on the 7Æ June 2018. The Mental Health Trust did not appoint a Care Co-Ordinator until prompted by the Priory on the 13 June 2018, The Care Co-Ordinator did not engage effectively with Hannah, her family or The Priory. Hannah did not improve at The Priory. Her psychiatrist there identified that it was not the most appropriate place for her and wanted her to go to the EDU. The EDU took a different view. Hannah's weight did not improve. Her anorexic thoughts did not improve. The consequence of this was that her suicidal ideation increased as her feelings of hopelessness increased. The placement of her in a setting not equipped to effectively deal with her severe anorexia has probably contributed to her death. The Priory did not request her notes from the EDU, particularly her counselling notes and as a result, they were not fully sighted of the specifics of her previously expressed thoughts of suicide. As a result, the level of risk in her leaving the unit whilst her mental health was. deteriorating was not fuly assessed. This has probably contributed to her death On the 12% July 2018, Hannah went to the first floor cafe at John Lewis, Cheadle with her parents. The height ofthe balustrade was such that once she was on a table she was able to jump from the caf√© to the | ground floor suffering catastrophic injuries. She died at Salford Royal Hospital on 13ù July 2018 from her injuries. CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concem. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- 1-The inquest heard that discharge planning including communication with GPs and families around risk was not effective. Key information was not shared with the GP or the family particularly when care moved back to the family; 2. There was no clear evidence of consideration of discharge medication and risk around prescribing of medication post discharge from the EDU. As a result Hannah was prescribed a month's supply of medication; 3. The suitability of acute mental health beds for young adults and lack of alternative provision The inquest heard that Hannah went to an acute adult psychiatric bed because the EDU felt that it was the wrong environment for her and there was no other alternative. The inquest heard that there were concems regarding the placement of a young adult in such a setting and how frightening it was to her; 4, Communication with private providers by NHS trusts once mental health trusts have placed individuals in private settings. During the time that Hannah was placed at the Priory the mental health trust who placed her did not have any discussion with Hannah, her family or the Priory regarding the placement. A care coordinator had been allocated by the Trust once requested by the Priory but no care coordination had taken place; 5.The expectations around information sharing with private providers and the expectation on private providers contracted by the NHS to seek information. The Priory did not request any notes from the EDU about Hannah. As a result they were unaware of detailed information held by the Trust regarding previously expressed suicidal ideation; 6. Understanding and communication by the Priory about the change in risk level when Hannah moved from a secure environment to periods of time outside the unit in the care of her family; 7. The inquest was told by the clinical lead for Eating Disorders of the high risk of Eating Disorders in high achieving students on courses such as medicine. In such cases, the inquest was told universities need to be alert to early signs of anxiety that risk leading to eating disorders developing. As par of this understanding by universities the inquest was {old of the need to recognise early signs of mental health issues and listen carefully from an early stage. The skill settraining of academics in welfare roles in relation to mental health was described as key and specific work with Eating Disorder services and training of those involved in welfare programmes supporting students can be effective; £8. The guidance in elation to the height of glass balustrades where items such as tables, in cafes open to the public including children and cother vulnerable people, are placed in close proximity to the glass. The glass balustrade in John Lewis was at a height that accorded with the required standard but by simply climbing onto the table that was adjacent to the balustrade Hannah was able to easily go over the balustrade.

The Priory did not request any notes from the EDU about Hannah. As a result they were unaware of detailed information held by the Trust regarding previously expressed suicidal ideation; 6. Understanding and communication by the Priory about the change in risk level when Hannah moved from a secure environment to periods of time outside the unit in the care of her family; 7. The inquest was told by the clinical lead for Eating Disorders of the high risk of Eating Disorders in high achieving students on courses such as medicine. In such cases, the inquest was told universities need to be alert to early signs of anxiety that risk leading to eating disorders developing. As par of this understanding by universities the inquest was {old of the need to recognise early signs of mental health issues and listen carefully from an early stage. The skill settraining of academics in welfare roles in relation to mental health was described as key and specific work with Eating Disorder services and training of those involved in welfare programmes supporting students can be effective; £8. The guidance in elation to the height of glass balustrades where items such as tables, in cafes open to the public including children and cother vulnerable people, are placed in close proximity to the glass. The glass balustrade in John Lewis was at a height that accorded with the required standard but by simply climbing onto the table that was adjacent to the balustrade Hannah was able to easily go over the balustrade.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Mr Watson was aged 72. The Community Mental Health Team advised on 18/10/18 that he required an immediate admission for inpatient mental health treatment for his own safety. However, this could not happen as no bed was available within the area. Three days later there was still no bed available. Mr Watson was not offered a bed out-of-area. 2. This report has similar themes to the 7 reports issued by the Birmingham and Solihull Coroners on 4/10/18. 3. However, the impact of Mr Watsonôs age is a new issue. 4. I heard evidence that: a. Younger and older adults will not normally be admitted as inpatients on mixed units. Beds on young adult units may have been available on 18-22 October 2018 but these were not considered. b. Beds in neighbouring areas are unavailable because of contractual issues. The closest out of area option is at least 70 miles away. Although Mr Watson was not offered an out of area bed, his wife was confident that had one been offered he would have declined because 70 miles was so far away. Whilst this distance is likely to deter a patient of any age from accepting the offer, it is particularly problematic for elderly patients and their families. c. Whilst remedial action is underway in response to the concerns raised in the 7 reports issued on 4/10/18, currently it still remains the position that at least one patient every day in Birmingham and Solihull is advised they require an immediate admission for inpatient mental health treatment but no bed is available within the area. 5. The lack of inpatient beds is a resource issue. My ongoing concerns are that (a) there are insufficient numbers of beds in Birmingham and Solihull, and (b) out-of-area beds are too far away."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì (1) Evidence was given during the inquest by SBP staff on the ward concerned, that the reason SBP staff did not arrange to collect Sasha and return her to the ward when her s.17 leave had been revoked, was that they did not have the resources to allow them to do this, despite it being their legal responsibility so to do. (2) Sashaôs mother gave evidence that SBPôs reliance on her bringing Sasha back to the ward when s.17 leave had been revoked, placed an unfair and intolerable burden on her, in circumstances when she and the rest of the family were struggling to keep Sasha safe. Knowing that SBP would not send someone out to collect Sasha made her feel that she had no choice but to agree to their request. (3) The last such occasion when SBP staff on the ward decided that Sashaôs s.17 leave should be revoked was on the afternoon of her death on 31.3.17. Although formal revocation of leave was never finalised, Sashaôs mother was given to believe that it would be, and again reluctantly agreed to bring Sasha back to the ward. Whilst with her mother, Sasha was able to run off and take the substantial Propranolol overdose which proved to be fatal."

Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death: Mr Garvin took his own life whilst suffering with depressive illness. 4 | Circumstances ofthe death. Ate time of his death Mr Garvin was under the care ofthe Community Mental Heath Team, however his mesdcation was being prescrites by his GP. There were intermittent communiation problems between the CMT and the GP rehis prescrting, In October 2017 he had required admission but due the lack of local beds he had been hospitalised in Miton Keynes. Mr Garvin's ness placed a lot of strain on his elderly wife, but she was not offered a carer's assessment prior his deat, His ness was treatment resistant, and he asked for private psychiatric assessment in @ search ofa cure. He saw a private psychiatrist on 19th January 2018 When the CMHT became aware that he had sought private treatment he was informed that he would be dlscharged rom the CMHT. He was informed ofthis by his CPN ata home visit of 29"" January 2018. This had 2 significant adverse effect on his mood. Just two days later, he took his own ite Iti the policy of Mr Garvin's consultant to discharge patients from NHS care if they ae taken for private woatment apparently ue to concern over potential communcation dificlies.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. The deceased suffered from emotional unstable personality disorder and was in crisis for most of 2018. The recommended treatment for his condition was psychological therapy. He had not had any psychological input since 2010. The inquest heard that whilst he was under the care of the home treatment team there was no access to psychology services. He had to be under the community mental health team to be able to access psychological services. There were periods when he was under the care of the community mental health team but at this time he remained on a long waiting list for psychological services. Throughout 2018 he never received any psychological services. I am concerned that the main treatment option for the deceased was not available to him due to internal structures and long waiting lists. 2. In August 2018 the deceased required inpatient treatment. There were no beds available and as a result he had further episodes of self-harm and suicide attempts. The availability of acute beds is a serious concern.

Heather Carey took her own ife when she had been inthe care of NHS Mental Health Services for 6% months; she had recently been placed on a walling lst of some 24 weeks for Cognive Analytical Therapy. Although Heather Carey was known to be pressed, compounded by the lack of medecaton preserbed to lessen thal depression, and at high risk of suicide from the time she had been discharged from hospital (Gollowing a serous overdose 6 weeks prior to her death) there was a falure to take adequate and appropriate acion to avert or reduce thal risk an, just 2 days before her eath, inappropriate steps were taken which may have increased thal isk. 7 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 04.07.47 Heather Carey was admitted 28 a voluntary patient to the Mental Health Unt, Tameside General Hospital, seeking treatment for her enduring mental liness diagnosed as bi-polar disorder. Heather was detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act on 13.07.17. On 24.08.17 Heather Carey was discharged. Her discharge medicaon was quetapine, intended to lessen the depih of het epressive. mood Swings. Heather was expecting a referral to have been made that day for a Psychotherapy assessment. On ischarge Heather Carey's Out Patient Cline Appointment was to be within 23 weeks (14.09.2017) but she was given an appointment on 04.10.17. Following this appointment Heather was referred for psychotherapy screeningfessessment.

Heather atlended for her psychotherapy assessment on 22.11.17. The psychotherapist was not aware of the recent overdose. Heather was old that she was ready to consider Cognitive Analytical Therapy but that there was a 24-week walling Ist. The Psychotherapist sensed a disappointment. The evidence showed that for Heather it Seemed ike all hope had gone. Thereafter Heather's disengagement from the mental health team worsened. (On the morning of 20.12.17 Heather Carey hanged herself at her home, The inquest Kentiied a number of issues wich likely contributed to Heathers decision to end her life.

Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Mr Watson was aged 72. The Community Mental Health Team advised on 18/10/18 that he required an immediate admission for inpatient mental health treatment for his own safety. However, this could not happen as no bed was available within the area. Three days later there was still no bed available. Mr Watson was not offered a bed out-of-area. 2. This report has similar themes to the 7 reports issued by the Birmingham and Solihull Coroners on 4/10/18. 3. However, the impact of Mr Watsonôs age is a new issue. 4. I heard evidence that: a. Younger and older adults will not normally be admitted as inpatients on mixed units. Beds on young adult units may have been available on 18-22 October 2018 but these were not considered. b. Beds in neighbouring areas are unavailable because of contractual issues. The closest out of area option is at least 70 miles away. Although Mr Watson was not offered an out of area bed, his wife was confident that had one been offered he would have declined because 70 miles was so far away. Whilst this distance is likely to deter a patient of any age from accepting the offer, it is particularly problematic for elderly patients and their families. c. Whilst remedial action is underway in response to the concerns raised in the 7 reports issued on 4/10/18, currently it still remains the position that at least one patient every day in Birmingham and Solihull is advised they require an immediate admission for inpatient mental health treatment but no bed is available within the area. 5. The lack of inpatient beds is a resource issue. My ongoing concerns are that (a) there are insufficient numbers of beds in Birmingham and Solihull, and (b) out-of-area beds are too far away."

It was expected in these circumstances that Mrs Edwards would have been transferred to Landough Hospital for a psychiatric liaison assessment, Instead, responsibility for any further assessment and treatment of Mrs Edwards was passed entirely to Mrs Edwards and her family. less capable family/indvidual may not have pursued help and fallen through the cracks. Furthermore, had Mrs Edwards been hospitalised, her treatment may have been diferent. {2} The consultation at the UHW on 23 August was poor. The history-taking was inadequate, as it did not reveal the true extent of Mrs Edwardsô risk in terms of previous suicide attempts and deep-seated mental health problems. Furthermore, inaccurate information was communicated to liaison psychiatry: they were told that Mrs Edwards had taken 2 tablets, when she had taken 20. (2) The GP practice may not have performed sultably frequent medication reviews with Mes Edwards.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: ì 1. Natalie HUNTERôs GP, gave live evidence about Miss HUNTERôs 18 previous serious attempts to take her life. During the course of his evidence he referred to the lack of Discharge Summaries from the Isle of Wight NHS Trust. He said it is not uncommon for a Discharge Summary not to be sent to a GPôs practice by the IOW NHS Trust, or if it is sent, for it to be sent very late after the patient has been discharged from the Trust. 2. raised concerns about this as the Discharge Summary should contain details of why the patient was admitted; what care they received during their time at the IOW NHS Trust; what medication they were prescribed, and whether such medication was intended to be continued; and whether there were going to require ongoing care/treatment as a result of this admission/treatment. 3. If no Discharge Summary is received, it has a big impact on the care that GPs are able to offer to their patients and the continuity of care which is needed, particularly in relation to mental health input. 4. On several occasions, had been unaware of the nature of the admissions (which were almost all linked to her serious suicidal attempts) ì and 3 significantly the ongoing risk of further attempts on Miss HUNTERôs life as he had either not received a Discharge Summary or had received it too late for it to have any meaningful input into Miss HUNTERôs care. 5. During the course of the live evidence I heard from , Service Manager for Community Mental Health Services at the Isle of Wight NHS Trust, in connection with the lack of sufficient numbers of out-of-hours mental health or Crisis staff which are available across the Isle of Wight. His evidence (which has since been supplemented by up-to-date figures), was that the team currently comprises of 11.1 full-time equivalent Band 6 mental health staff members, but it really requires 15.74 full-time equivalent appropriately qualified staff members which would necessitate 4.64 full-time equivalent additional staff to be funded and recruited in order to be able to offer a full and effective service. 6. The evidence was that there are currently insufficient funds in order for a full complement of out-of-hours mental health/Crisis staff to be deployed which is affecting the way in which the Mental Health service operates and delivers care to those who need it out-of-hours. 7. Accordingly, I have concerns that those who are vulnerable with mental health issues and who need to be seen out-of-hours are currently not in receipt of an adequately staffed out-of-hours mental health provision."

Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust (BCHTô) iv. G4S v. The Ministry of Justice (MOJô),"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. There is confusion surrounding the meaning of the following question from NHS Englandôs national clinical template for in possession Risk Assessments in the Secure Estate: úHave you had problems in the last 6 months with not taking, or not remembering to take your medicines as prescribed?ù The Risk Assessment had not been used in the assessment for Mr. Delahayeôs in possession modification on the 29th January 2018 when it ought to have been. However, during the course of considering what the outcome would have been if the risk assessment had been undertaken, more than one clinician interpreted the question as pertaining only to consideration of incidents where medication had not been taken. It was the Coronerôs view that the question is also asking about incidents where medication may have been taken but not úas prescribedù thus encompassing an overdose (accidental or deliberate). The question is not clear and this creates a risk that the score generated may be incorrect and in possession medication may be authorised where it ought not to be, putting lives at risk. 2. During the inquest it emerged that the mental health nurse who assessed Mr. Delahaye on the 2nd January 2018 and the GP who assessed him for in possession medication on the 29th January 2018, had not identified from his notes all relevant past medical conditions. It emerged that whilst the System One records (a case management system used across the prison estate) has the facility to provide a summary of significant past and current medical conditions, it is not reliable at HMP Birmingham because conditions are not consistently given the correct read codeô. Evidence from the NHS England clinical reviewer, , was that this problem is not unique to HMP Birmingham and is found in other prison healthcare teams and requires a change of culture and practice to bring the system for read coding into line with that in the community. The absence of a reliable source for quickly identifying relevant past and current medical conditions puts lives at risk from misinformed decision making. 3. No member of the healthcare team was present at any of Mr. Delahayeôs ACCT reviews. It was identified during the inquest that a member of either the mental health team, primary care or the drug/alcohol service ought to have been present at the first review at least. It was the evidence of a first line manager who had involvement in the ACCT that a member of the custodial team had contacted healthcare and asked them to attend but this was not documented and the healthcare team maintained they were unaware of the date of the first review. Whilst the ACCT book provides a checklist of actions to be undertaken at various times it does not include making healthcare aware of the first review. As this is a national Ministry of Justice form, HMP Birmingham canôt change it but a failure to inform healthcare of an ACCT review could result in useful knowledge or expertise not being available to the ACCT team and could put lives at risk. 4. On the morning of the 5th March 2018 Mr. Delahayeôs cell had been unlocked at approximately 07:50. It is likely that he was already dead at this time (and had been so for some hours) but he was not found because the prison custody officer who unlocked his cell did not look into the cell or seek any kind of acknowledgement from Mr. Delahaye. It was acknowledged by the relevant PCO and by the Safer Custody Manager that unlock ought to have involved a welfare check. The Safer Custody Managerôs evidence is that the need for a welfare check on unlock has been emphasised to senior managers and leads through a bilateral document covered at formal briefings. However, it was not clear how this is then communicated down to the individual custody officers and how they are being audited to make sure they are conducting a welfare check on unlock. The absence of a welfare check creates a risk that a prisoner in need of life saving assistance at the time of unlock is not identified."

Tnvestigation and Inquest On 13 May 2016, an investigation was commenced into the death of PATRICIA. PRISCILLA CHAMBERS, born on 8 February 1965. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest heard before a jury between 15 and 23 October 2018. Circumstances of the Death (On 11 May 2016, Patricia Chambers died by suicide contributed to by neglect. She had not recently taken her antipsychotic medication risperdione, and had recently used cannabis. She climbed over the balcony of the communal walkway on the ninth floor of Tom Williams House, where she lived, and jumped to the ground. She sustained multiple injuries which were non-survivable. Intervention by the Metropolitan Police Service before she jumped could not prevent her death, The West London Mental Health Trust operates and is responsible forthe Hammersmith and Fulham Mental Health Unit. Patricia Chambers had been an in- patient in the Unit in March 2016. The jury found thatthe discharge process in March 2016 had been incomplete and {inadequate in the following respects: A.A final risk assessment was not completed prior to her discharge from the ward. . The discharge medication summary form was not completed accurately in respect of prescription instructions forthe GP. C. The meeting in respect of the discharge did not follow best practice guidelines and did not include Community Mental Health Team or family members. . The úseven-day follow-upù recorded was inadequate and prevented effective follow-up care. E. The discharge from the ward was not communicated to the CMHT and this absence of communication led toa lack of access to her prescribed drugs. F. Consistent continuity of care, both in terms of appropriate contact with CMHT or GP and subsequent application of prescriptions, was lacking due to Patricia Chambers's discharge having not been communicated appropriately. I 2 00 202 oeings ie Steet Bash Metal Centre, wer was Patricia Chambersô General Practice. The jury found that the following indirect factors contributed to Patricia Chamberss death A.

Coroner's Concerns: West London Mental Health Trust The evidence during the course ofthe inquest revealed matters of concer, which were reflected in the jury's conclusions. In my opinion, there isa risk of future deaths which may be prevented if appropriate action is taken. Inthe circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to the West London Mental Health Trust. heard in the course ofthe inquest evidence from A a since February 2018 been the Head of Operations for Access & Urgent Care for the Trust. I address this report directly to her on the basis that she seems to me to be the person who has both sufficient seniority and sufficient proximity to operational matters to take action (or supervise the taking of action). 1 acknowledge that the Trust carried out a Serious Incident Review under the chairmanship of SEMEN which was critical of the Trust in tances of Patricia Chambersôs death. An action plan was then created and| explained in evidence (which | accept) the various effective steps which have now been taken. Thave since heard, through counsel, thatthe Trust has reflected on the evidence and the jury's findings, and accepts tha there i still concern in respect of: + The Discharge Medication Summary (úthe Summaryù) and the 7-Day Follow-Up, which need to be redrawn = Communication ofthe Summary to other parties (in particular the CMHT, the GP and Pharmacy) = Consistency of the Summary with C2, the Care Programme Approach Policy (which policy, I understand, is itself currently under review) ~ Compliance of the CPA with the Code of Practice (in particular paragraph 34.11 of the Code of Practice) - The appointment, training and supervision of the role of Primary Nurse on the Ward.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì In October 2016 Davy was referred by his GP to the community mental health team (CMHT), part of Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (CPT) for assessment of possible Attention deficit hyperactivity disorderô (ADHD) which is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Davy was assessed in December 2016 by CMHT. However, Davy was discharged from CMHT without further diagnosis and treatment. This was because of the following reasons;- 1) CPT is not commissioned to assess, diagnose or treat adult ADHD. 2) Addaction Cornwall does not have access to a specialist psychiatrist with the skills to diagnose or treat ADHD. 3) Although the GP had the option to refer under Patient Choice for treatment out of county, the GPs previous experience indicated that this was impracticable because it would not be possible to successfully deliver the ongoing oversight and review of medication. In summary, Davy could not be diagnosed and treated by specialist services either in Cornwall or out of county."

There was a lack of involvement of family members and in particular, the concept of a triangle of care which involved family, the patient and the medical team had largely been ignored. 4. There did not appear to be a system of peer review within the mental health teams nor a system of external audit as regards the adequacy of care plans and medical records. 5. Unqualified staff were relied upon in circumstances where qualified staff should have been assigned. 6. There appeared to be deficiencies in the supervision of unqualified mental health workers. 7. There was little evidence of multi-disciplinary working in relation to an individual with complex mental health needs. 8. When there was a change in personnel responsible for the care of the patient, there appeared to be a lack of a proper handover between the healthcare professionals. 9. Much of the above implied serious gaps in the adequacy of training / knowledge, the allocation of time, the acquisition and deployment of necessary skills and the establishment of satisfactory ways of working. 10. The on-call rota for duty consultants meant that consultant psychiatrists on occasions faced a full day of clinical work immediately following the completion of a 12 hour night time duty, without any period of rest and recuperation."

I heard evidence at the inquest that this call was graded incorrectly. It should have been graded as a P2 call with a response time within 60minutes. I also heard evidence to confirm that the large number of P1 calls that evening meant that even if the call had been correctly graded it would not have been answered as all available resources were required for the P1 calls (15 minutes response). The evidence confirmed that nearly all the P2 and P3 calls went unanswered that night. This raises a serious concern about the amount of resources available to West Midlands Police. Urgent attention is needed to address the resources available, particularly at night, as current resources are unable to deal with the large volume of cases the Force is expected to deal with."

Following receipt of that certificate Mr Hill acquired a .22 calibre Jong barrelled rifle which he used to end his life 6 weeks later on the 26"" May 2017. Mr Hill's son had no knowledge of the application his father had made until after it was granted. He and his sister had concems with their father having access to a firearm, as Mr Hill had told them that when the time came he would end his life by shooting himself with a rifle, At the time of Mr Hills application, enquiries were made by Dorset Police which did not include anyôenguiries with the family of Mr Hil or his wife with whom he was living, although the Firearms Enquiry Officer did see Mrs Hill when she went to interview Mr Hill on the 20 March.

There is no further reference to speaking to family members friends or associates under any other circumstances. Evidence was further given that in the Dorset Police policy entitled Firearms and Explosive Licensing Risk Management Procedureô dated the 8 May 2015 there is no reference to such Contact with family members, friends or associates and that family members or those living at the same address of the applicant, will not be contacted as standard practice. They may, a above, be contacted where there Is evidence of domestic abuse. Evidence was given that t would be beneficial for the Firearms Unit at Dorset Police to write to those living with the applicant to invite them to raise any concerns they wish to in relation to the application. Although this may not be responded to, at last it dives those close to the applicant an opportunity to raise their oncems.

The inquest was resumed and concluded on 158 May 2018 1 found thatthe cause of death to be: Ja.

It is found that he intended hhis death. At the time of his death he was under the supervision of the mental health services in the community, and although there was an opportunity to admit him to hospital, it remains unclear whether it would have made a difference to the outcome. 4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH Mr Seatby had a history of suffering from extreme anxiety and depression for which he was under the auspices of his GP and MHS. When he failed to attend his medical review appointment on 27/7/17 as expected, his community Psychiatric Nurse made several unsuccessful attempts to contact him by phone before attending at his home address to find no response.

He was assessed by a member of the Criminal Liaison and Diversion Service (CLDS) on the same day and was initially assessed by them as being at risk of self-harm. The member of the CLDS subsequently telephoned the Home Treatment Team to discuss referring him to the service. Mr Tidey was then re-assessed by the same member of the CLDS who stated he appeared calmer and was no immediate risk to himself. No notes were recorded on the Police or Mental Health Service computer system to record how this assessment of reduced risk of self-harm had been reached. During the following months, no contact was made by mental health services with Mr Tidey, and he did not seek their assistance. On 26th October 2016 he attended Guildford Police Station to be charged with the offences and was assessed by Police and a member of the CLDS as being at low risk of harm to self. On Friday 16th December 2016, Police were made aware that Mr Tidey had lost his job as a consequence of being charged with the offences and therefore that one of the contingent events highlighted in the MASH referral of 3.2.2016 as placing Mr Tidey at higher risk of self-harm had materialised. They therefore completed a further MASH referral form and this was emailed to the MASH hub at 15.40 and forwarded on to Waverley CMHRS at 16.41. On Monday 19th December 2016 at 11.30am, Waverley CMHRS forwarded the MASH report to Guildford CMHRS, but then emailed again at 11.36am to state they noted Waverley CMHRS should actually follow up Mr Tidey. However, for reasons, which cannot be ascertained, no further action was taken. It is not possible to ascertain who the duty 3 RT4563 worker was who received the referral by email. , Community Services Manager for South West Community Mental Health Recovery Service, stated in evidence that had he received Mr Tideyôs MASH referral on 16th December 2016, he would have taken action the same day, initially via a telephone triage assessment and then via the options available of HTT referral; EDT Mental Health Act Assessment, crisis planning with safe havens or CMHRS non-crisis support, as appropriate. Evidence was given that there were no safeguards in place to check referrals were being acted upon, and that this remains the case. Mr Tidey was found deceased on 22nd December 2016, the day before he was due to attend Court for sentencing. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: - How MASH reports are processed by the MASH team upon receipt; - Whether there is an effective system in place to ensure that MASH reports are followed up by the appropriate Community Mental Health Team (where necessary); and - Whether there is an effective system in place to deal appropriately with MASH referrals received outside normal weekday office hours, and that those completing the MASH referral forms (e.g. Police officers) know where these should be send outside normal working hours when a high risk is identified Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to address the above concerns."

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. I heard at inquest that no member of the team on Roman Ward contacted Fallonôs social worker. There was no protocol for this. If they had sought a collateral history from the social worker, they would have discovered that Fallonôs mum was not dead as Fallon had told them, but was alive and living in a hostel. The social worker had been rung by a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, but she was waiting to be invited to a ward round at Mile End Hospital and such invitation was never made. It seems unlikely that proper discussion with the social worker would have changed the outcome for Fallon, but it would have meant that valuable information would have been shared, and it would have meant that Fallon would have had the benefit of her social worker on hand upon discharge. This might be very important for another patient."

It is not acceptable that local people needing in-patient detox have to travel to Islington away from family and friends. Its also unacceptable that the waiting list isso long especially when often Mental Health wil not be fully adceossed unl detox has taken place. How many dual agnosis patents are there in the UK? (2) A much more collaborative approach to dual diagnosis patient's treatment is needed. The dual diagnosis is at the heart of this problem. Itis not appropriate to try to Separate each component and only agree to treat/assess one component when the other is dealt with. The dual diagnosis is the person. When in crisis they are doubly at risk.

He had expressed suicidal | ation to mental health practitioners but not recently to his family Mr Kieranôs mood was said to have worsened during the week or so prior to his death. He had become very withdrawn On the evening of Saturday 3 June Me Kiernan made an emergency cal but then aborted the call without providing any Informatio. In accordance with standard practice, the matter was {orwarded to an emergency cal handler who, at 22:18, succeeded in contacting and speaking to Mr Kiernan. The cal handle found it very √©iffcut to obtain information from Mr Kieran. He was uncooperative and appeared to be inoxicated. However, he did make a threat to harm | himself, The emergency call handler graded the call as ""immediate"" to ansure the prompt | despatch of resources. Police officers arrived at Mr Kiernan's home at around 22:30. They found that both Mr and fl Kiernan were present was unaware that her husband had been in contact withthe emergency services, She arected the Officers to Mr Kiemanôs bedroom. The Officers found Mr Kiernan holding a small hand axe. The offcers instructed Mr Kiernan to pul the axe onthe floor. After several seconds he complied withthe request and apologised saying that he did not know who was about to enter his bedroom. Me Kiernan was sluring his words when he spoke tothe officers.

During the conversations that took place, Mr Kiernan was generally fbrasive in manner and cffcut fo understand.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows : It was apparent from the evidence that there were five principal failures by the Trust in relation to the treatment and care provided to the Deceased. These were: (1) The Deceased was first assessed by the Trustôs Early Intervention and Assertive Psychosis Team who recognised that she was in need of psychiatric treatment and care by another team but, despite referring her on to other psychiatric teams within the Trust, made no effective transfer of her care before discharging her back to her General Practitioner and closing her case. A significant number of clinical and managerial staff were involved in this process and none of them prevented the Deceasedôs premature discharge. (2) Prior to the Deceasedôs discharge no sufficient assessment was made of her risk of suicide. Despite at least two clinical staff being involved, there was insufficient evidence gathering, including from the Deceasedôs family, and a wholly inadequate assessment was made despite the use of the Trustôs electronic assessment tool (which was not properly completed). Further, no plan was put in place to manage the Deceasedôs recognised risk of suicide. (3) Prior to the Deceasedôs discharge no care plan was put in place and no single person had responsibility for ensuring her care was properly assessed, co-ordinated and delivered prior to discharge. (4) The Deceased was discharged back to the care of her General Practitioner with a recommendation for the prescription of psychiatric medication without her having been seen or assessed by the psychiatrist who made the recommendation and with no means of monitoring its subsequent effectiveness. (5) Despite the matters set out in (1) to (4), the General Practitionerôs request, made on 15 March 2016, for an urgent assessment was not granted and the Trustôs Access and Assessment Team provided an appointment for a date five weeks later on 20 April 2016. I was told by witnesses from the Trust (and in submissions made on behalf of the Trust) that the Trust had adequate relevant policies and procedures in place at the time and that the failings set out above occurred because all the staff involved failed to follow those policies and procedures. It was said that there has been no subsequent amendment of the policies and procedures but, in summary, that staff have been reminded of them and what ought to happen (by email) and there is now an increased level of monitoring of compliance. Whilst the staff directly involved, who gave oral evidence at the inquest, told me that they now understand that the above failings ought not to have happened and would not occur now, I remain concerned that one or more of the above failings could recur in the future. Although the Trust has taken steps to inform current staff of what went wrong in the Deceasedôs case, it has not taken steps to ensure that the above failings could not occur again (whether by amendment or clarification of its policies and/or procedures or sufficient training of staff or otherwise). Most particularly, the evidence provided to me did not satisfy me that the Trustôs policies and procedures, and the training given upon them, now ensure that every patient who is referred to the Trust will be assessed and treated in a timely manner, even if transfer between teams is necessary. Nor did it satisfy me that every patientôs risk of suicide is now properly assessed and managed so as to ensure the risk is minimised. In all the circumstances I consider that there is an ongoing risk that any one or more of the above failings could recur. If that risk is permitted to continue, it could have an adverse impact on the assessment, treatment and care of current and future patients and upon the protection of their lives."

The inquest, which was held with a jury, ended with a narrative conclusion. The medical cause of death was given as ligature compression of the neck. úThe jury concluded that Sarah Reed took her own lfe at a time when the balance of her mind was disturbed to which a failure in management of her |_| medication contributed. The jury was not sure that Sarah intended to take her wn life. The jury also concluded thatthe failure to finish the fitness to plead | assessment process in a sufficiently timely manner contributed to her death. The jury also concluded, amongst other things. that there was. - | (2) failure by the mental health staf at HMP Holloway to act in a timely manner on the recommendation of a community health team psychiatrist that anti- psychotic medication be considered, despite specifically requesting his input; (©) failure in the management of her medication, including falling to provide an anti-psychotic medication as a safer alternative to Quetiapine (which had to be lopped for good medical reasons), particularly pending transfer to hospital, and 2 lack of a contingency plan to manage her psychosis or the recurrence of it with the result that Sarah was not receiving adequate treatment for her deteriorating mental heath state, leaving her in a distressed state; (c) inappropriate reduction ofthe frequency of observations at Assessment Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) Review No.4 on 5 January 2016, six days before her death, with the decision being made by a review team that was not mult-discipinary (@) failure by some of those attending ACCT Reviews to read and review the whole ACCT document before making a decision; (@) unacceptable delay before holding a Care Programme Approach (CPA) | meeting for long-term planning and inappropriate quality of the meeting when held; and ()an unacceptable number of canceled visi including a solicitors visit, which Contributed significantly to Sarah's isolation, CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH | The deceased took her oun lfe on 11 January 2016 in a single occupancy cell in C1, the mental health assessment unit, of HMP Holloway, North London. She strangled herself with a tight ligature made from bed linen. She had been remanded in custody by the Inner London Crown Court on 14 October 2015 solely for the purpose of obtaining one or more reports on her fitness to plead and stand trial on a charge of alleged serious assault upon a | nurse at a psychiatric hospital. She had previously been on bail, but while on bal she had failed to attend two appointments in the community with psychiatrist forthe purpose of their assessment of her fitness to plead. According to the Case Log, the Judge at the Crown Court expressed the view on 14 October 2015 that cant see any way these reports will be prepared Whilst the defendant remains on bailô Atthe hearing on 14 October 2015 the Judge therefore ordered the Court to obtain these reports and remanded Sarah in custody. She was taken to HMP Holloway. By the time of Sarah's death on 11 January 2016, three months later, one report hhad been obiained. It was dated 11 January 2016. A second report was due on 18 January 2016. No date had been fixed by the Crown Cour fora hearing to determine the issue of her finess to plead. There was agreed evidence that Sarahôs mental condition deteriorated in HMP Holloway for the lat three weeks of her life, particularly from ß January 2016 when she was moved to the mental health assessment unit (C1). She had been on observation watch under an ACCT procedure (he second procedure since reception), which had been opened on 28 December 2015 and was sill open at the time of her death. On reception, it was noted that Sarah had been assessed as previously sulfering variously rom Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), Schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar affective disorder, alcohol and substance abuse, and bulimia nervosa. She had been admitied to HMP Holloway and other prisons since 2008 and had been sectionedô on a number of occasions. The Seteroraion of her menial health and appearances before criminal courts dated in the main from the period after the death in September 2003 of her six month ld daughter rom spinal muscular atrophy. CORONER'S CONCERNS: During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. Inthe citcumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~ A. Fitness to Plead Reports (1) The deceased had been remanded in custody for the sole purpose of the Court obtaining two reports by psychiatrists on her fitness to plead and stand tral, Yet by the time of her death, three months later, this objective had not been ieved and no date for a hearing ofthe issue had been fixed. itis clear from the evidence that Sarah was uncertain what was happening and when she would be going to court (2) On 7 January 2016, four days before her death, doctors at HMP Holloway had decided that Sarah should be referred to a secure hospital for assessment and treatment. They concluded that she suffered from EUPD and psychosis and ""was in effect unmanageable in prison, having refused medication and failed to comply with request for blood and ECG tests. Hed the Court obtained the psyehvatre reports on ness to plead earlier, the Court may well have imposed ß hospital order (with or without a restriction order) under section 5(2)a) ofthe Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964. The two necessary requirements would | have been easly satisfied: the reports wer to find her unft to plead and she had admited the act charged, namely srking a mental health nurse over the head wih @ metal barn June 2014 (3) By the time of her death the deceased had been given no target date for the hearing ofthe ise of her fitness to plead. Her cary entries suggest that the hearing was important to her and in he forefront of her ming. An ear date of 14 December 2015 had been vacated and not replaced. Het mental state and behaviour in prison deteriorated markedly fom late December 2016 to 11 January 2016, {4) twas not clear onthe evidence who took responsibility fr obtaining the reports, The Court had ordered ther, But the formal request or he frst report, dated 27 October 2015, was (2) directed to HMP Holloway, but (b) sent by email {rom the Court to an administrative offer employed not bythe prison but bythe Central ang North West London NHS Trust (CNWL) who worked from HMP Holloway. One month later, on 27 November 2015, a psychiatrist employed by CCNWL in HMP Holoway wrote back to the Cour, apologising fr the delay and ingicating that the request be directed not to CNWL but tothe South London and Maudsley NHS TrustAs a result, by about six weeks after the Cours order, no psychiatrist had yet agreed to prepare a report. {5).The jury found thatthe evidence that Key members of Sarah's mental health team in HMP Holloway were unaware thal the sole purpose of her remand in custody was forthe preparation of finess to plead reports was incomprehensible. (6) The jury concluded that the failure to conclude the fitness to plead assessment process ina sufficiently timely manner contributed to Sarah's death B. ACCT Reviews and Observations | (7) The jury concluded thatthe decision to reduce the frequency of observations on Sarah Reed at ACCT Review No.4 on 5 January 2016, six days before Sarah's death, was inappropriate given the clear evidence of the deterioration of her mental stat. (8) The jury also found that the above decision was not mult-disciplinary, which should have been (as the senior Governor conceded in evidence). (8) The jury also found that not all members of the ACCT Review team ful reviewed the ACCT document before making a decision (10) The jury also found the system of some members of the mult-disciplinary team recording observations which were not accessible to all other members of the team to be detrimentalô. For example, many helpful observations about Sarah's behaviour were recorded inthe prison medical notes on SystemOne by doctors and nurses, but they were not accessible to prison officers, | (11) In addition the Coroner observes that HMP Holloway maintained a practice of recording observations on prisoners which deviated from the national instruction. According tothe national policy Management of prisoners at risk of harm fo self, to others and from others (Safer Custody) (PSI 64/2011) observations should be recorded immediately or as soon as practicable thereafter. According tothe local policy at HMP Holloway, as implemented in this case, any observations at any time need be recorded only at four hour Intervals in summary for, ©. CPA Meeting (12) The jury concluded that the delay in holding a Care Programme Approach (CPA) meeting was unacceptable. The evidence showed that a CPA Meeting for assessing a prisoners long-term care should have been held within four weeks from reception. In this case it was held after nine weeks. (13) The jury also found thatthe quality ofthe meeting was not appropriate. It Tasted five minutes and only the nurse care coordinator and community psychiatrist were present with the prisoner. D. Visits (14) The jury concluded that the number of cancelled visits was unacceptable, particularly fora prisoner such as Sarah with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder where engagement isa principal means of treatment (15) The senior Governor atthe time of Sarah's death found records that in the Felevant period 19 visits were scheduled, of which eight were cancelled (one Visitor did not attend, three were cancelled because of Sarahôs behaviour and four were cancelled with no reason given), three were completed and eight were listed as scheduledô (which probably meant completed but was not clear). The st cancelled visit was by a solicitor; she was simply tld that Sarah was úunwell (18) The Governor conceded that the records for cancellations were insufficient | and all cancellations should have been sanctioned at the level of Duty Governor (which they were not) and not by staf of lesser seniority. (17) The Coroner also observes that with a litle thought and effort arrangements could be made fora visit for Sarah even when her mental state had affected her behaviour. For example, on one occasion on 2 January 2016 (and apparently on one occasion only), Sarah's mother was allowed to see Sarah in the adjudication room on the Segregation Unit (where Sarah was then housed). Itis clear from the evidence that this visit was helpful to Sarah and that more completed visits would have assisted her. The jury so found (18) The Coroner also observes that the information provided to visitors including close family was often shor on detail and lacked helpful information. E. Notification of Prisoner's Release (19) There was evidence from Sarah's care coordinator in the community, a Social worker with the START Team, that she was never informed by HMP Holloway ofthe release of any prisoner whom she had previously supported in | the community, despite the care coordinator having close links with the prison, for example visting prisoners she had supported and sometimes taking part in CPA meetings. The care coordinator said that this would be incredibly helpful. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you have the power to take such action. A. Fitness to Plead Reports MoJ; HMCTS; HMPPS; CNWL You may wish to consider whether the procedures for obtaining and providing psychiatric reports on the issue of fitness to plead, when ordered by the court, are sufficiently timely, suficiently robust and sufficiently well-managed. In particular HMCTS may wish to consider whether the courts have sulficient control over the process under present procedures so as produce reports | sufficiently promptly and whether timetabling including the setting of court dates could be more efficiently and effectively scheduled. lam aware, from a helpful letter in reply to me as Coroner from the Senior residing Judge (SP4), dated 21 Apri 2017, that this specific issue is not covered by either the Criminal Procedure Rules or the Criminal Practice Directions issued by the Lord Chief Justice. The SPU has also informed me, as] hhas HMCTS, thatthe office of the SPJ and HMCTS wil be reissuing guidance (on the provision of psychiatric reports for sentencing purposes, although fitness to plead is a separate issue from sentencing and isnot included inthe current guidance. | B. ACCT Reviews and Observations Mod; HMPPS; CNWL Despite much past consideration of the ACCT process and a number of reports {rom coroners about it, the Ministry of Justice and HMPPS in particular may wish to consider afresh whether action should be taken to improve the ACCT process and the process of review. In particular consideration could be given tothe following: (i) whether a single sheet of ongoing risk and assessment, noting especially negative highlights, should be introduced for easy access and reading by those attending a review, | Gy whether al those attending a review should be required to read the ACCT document in ful; and (ii) whether those attending a review should always be multi-disciplinary (as required) and whether those attending should be more consistently the same personnel Consideration should also be given to access tothe recording of observations, particularly of adverse behaviour ofthe prisoner, for al staff who have the care of prisoners, In this case medical staf had made extensive records (not of a medically confidential nature) to which prison officers did not have access, thus tendering their information about the prisoner incomplete The Ministry of Justice may also wish to consider whether itis acceptable that a prison should be permitted to develop a local policy, in this case on recording Observations, which is at variance with a national policy. This is not the first ime that a local policy may have been in conflict with @ national policy. In the | decision of the High Court in R (Maxine HamitonsJackson) v HM Assistant Coroner for Mid Kent and Medway [2016] EWHC 1796 (Admin), the local policy on when to open an ACCT document difered from the national policy, partly because it was based on an out-of-date national policy. In this context the Coroner notes that the Government Legal Department have indicated in a helpful letter to the Coroner dated 25 July 2017 that Safer Custody Learning Bulletins, which highlight the need to record ACCT observations as soon as possible after they are madeô, will be issued to all prisons on 27 July 2017. The Coroner welcomes this and notes that this approach accords with the ational policy and not the local policy which was in force at HMP Holloway at the time of Sarah's death (and which had previously been criticised by the | Prisons and Probation Ombudsman) ©. CPA Meeting Mod; HMPPS; CNWL Consideration should be given to ensuring that the purpose of CPA Meetings is property satisfied both as fo their nature and quality. According tothe evidence they are intended for long-term planning ofthe prisoner's care. In this case the meeting was held after nine weeks, not within four (as required); lasted five minutes; and only two persons in addition to the prisoner were present. Itis not sufficient for the care coordinator to say, as inthis case: | was not able to get The right people together on an earlier dateù D. Visits Mod; HMPPS A remand prisoner is entitled to a visit every day subject to the requirements of goad order and security. The evidence also emphasised the importance of visits fora prisoner with Sarah's mental disorders so as to encourage engagement and to avoid isolation and feelings of isolation Consideration should therefore be given to the procedure for canceling visits, - (i) whether visits should be cancelled only at Duty Governor level and not by less senior staff; (i whether there should be better recording of visits including cancelled visits and the reason for cancellation; (ii) whether better and clearer explanation could be given to a visitor (family friends and lawyers) when a visit is cancelled and preferably in advance of the meeting: and (iv) whether special visiting arrangements could be made more often for prisoners, particularly remand prisoners, who have exhibited problem behaviour E. Notification of Prisoner's Release MoJ; HMPPS; CNWL Consideration should be given to informing external agencies, in this case such 2a the START Team, of the impending or actual release of a prisoner. (On the facts of this case Sarah was not released or due to be released. But there was. evidence that other prisoners had been released without the prison informing relevant agencies who were known to the prison and would be expected to provide care and support to the vulnerable inthe community.)

He was therefore discharged from the service on the 21 June 2016. ] There was no attempt to vieithim during this period to try and re-engage him with | services. He may not have received the correspondence inviting him for appointments because he was away on holiday for some of that period. He might have benefitted from having pre-arranged appointments prior to his discharge. His medication was changed during his last admission and thereafter does not appear tohave been monitored.

November 2016 1 concluded the Inquest into the death of Thomas Josef Green date of birth Iù November 1994 who died on the 10"" June 2016 at this home address in Denton, Tameside Manchester. {recorded that the deceased had a complex background. He had been assaulted in 2011 and also involved in # road traffic collision. These together with other life events weie felt to have led toa diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder. The medical cause of death was confirmed as 1a) Asphyxiation secondary to hanging Conclusion ~ Deceased had taken his own life CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The Inquest into the death of Thomas Green had heard evidence that in August 2011 at the age of 16 he was assaulted. Following this he had difficulties leaving the house and became more isolated. On the first occasion he ventured out he was involved in @ road traffic collision whereby as a pedestrian he was hit by a motor vehicle which didnôt stop, sustaining injures to his head and legs. The Court heard that following this the deceaseds behaviour and personality totally changed. He was a virtual recluse, over time he became violent towards family members, he became paranoid and had mood swings. In September hhe was referred to the Early Intervention Team as he had expressed both suicidal and homicidal thoughts. Throughout October 2014 his violent behaviour Gacalated towards family member and on the 13Æ November 3014 he was sectioned under Section 2 Mental Health Act. He remained an inpatient under the care of EIN from the 13.11.14 until the 5.12.14. During his admission he was diagnosed wit Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Despite his inpatient stahus he was refered by III on the 208 Novembet 2014 to General Adult Psychiatry due to his úmixed personality disorder with paranoid and antisocial traits.ù I was unclear what happened with this releral But it was noted, as sited that this referral was made whilst Mr Green sas an inpatient. | | Whilst an inpatient Mr Green was also diagnosed as having @ pineal tumour. On his discharge from hospital Mr Green was placed under the Home treatment team. He remained under the Home Treatment team until 1"" April 2015 at which stage he was discharged back to his GP. On his discharge from hospital there was no follow-up by a Consultant Psychiatrist nor was there any referral for treatment for his diagnosis of Post traumatic stress disorder. In July 2015 his GP made a referral to Tameside and Glossop Healthy Minds for one to one CBT. He had his first assessment on the 26"" October 2015 at which stage he had a PHQ 9 score of 25 and a GAD score of 17. Due to difficulties attending and sporadic contact Mr Green was discharged from the Service. A funher referral was made by his GP in May 2016 and the deceased was on a waiting lst at the time he died. CORONER'S CONCERNS The concems noted by the Court during the course ofthe Inquest are as follows: Pennine Care NHS Trust, Churchgate Surgery and Tameside and Glossop CCG 1. It was unclear why a referral was made to Adult General Psychiatry whilst Mr Green remained an inpatient, there was no evidence that referral was ever considered or actioned. 2, Hence when Mr Green was discharged from hospital there was no Psychiatric follow-up and no treatment plan in place to address the diagnosis of complex PTSD. 3. When a referral was made this was made to Healthy Minds. The Court heard evidence how this was not a case which was suitable for Healthy is as it was complex and involved potentially complex PTSD. 4. The Court heard evidence thatthe referral document completed by the GP was not particularly detailed and therefore the complexity of the case was ot apparent and the case was accepted. 5. The Court heard evidence that there is a commissioning gap for the provision of services for Complex PTSD and complex presentations such as that of Mr Green.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì 1. FOR SEPT:- The admitted lacuna in the SEPT admissions protocol governing the transfer of mentally disordered people from police custody. The current admissions protocol does not allow for the transfer of any individual from police custody, irrespective of the criminal charges the individual is facing. Cont¶¶ 3 2. FOR SEPT AND NHS ENGLAND:- The absence of a written record of the úbest practiceù forensic pathway referred to by in his evidence, and consideration of whether the transfer of individuals such as Dean to prison is indeed úbest practiceù, taking into account the consequent delay in transfer and the suitability of the prison environment for mentally disordered individuals. 3. FOR CARE UK, NOMS, SEPT:- The lack of clarity regarding the hospital transfer process. The evidence at the inquest demonstrated that this is currently shrouded in confusion and contradiction (if the PSI and the NHS England úgood practiceù is compared). Given that rationalisation of the process is still a úwork in progressù, the family consider that it should be given urgent consideration. 4. FOR NOMS:- Training regarding the ACCT process. In previous prison deaths and in response to previous PPO reports, promises have been made about training having been provided to staff yet the same mistakes are being repeated. Meaningful action in required in this regard. 5. FOR NHS ENGLAND:- The resilience of psychiatric cover at Chelmsford prison, which would need to be raised with NHS England who commission such services and decide on the budget. 6. FOR NOMS:- The meaningful involvement of families in the ACCT process, including by ensuring the formal recording, and communication of concerns raised by a prisonerôs family."

""The MATTERS OF CONCERN ate as follows. 1. The expert psychiatrist gave an opinion that there was a defect in the system of communications between professionals and agencies involved in the eare of Mr Walsh. There appeared to be not only serious failures of communication, but failures from inadequate processes of communication between custodial and health professionals, between police, court, health care and prison services, that progressively lost crucial information about the risks and needs ofthe deceased as the passed through different hands. The expert described what staff knew at HMP. Belmarsh as diluted and grossly distorted. Evidence heard is listed 1) Those conducting the MHA assessment did not discover that, on the very evening of the assessment, the police had been in contact withthe deceased smother, who had key information about his mental health, nor did examine the custody record or log, nor consult the Detained Persons Medical Forms, which one described as usually containing litte useful information. The Custody officers and MHA assessors never spoke. 1) The AMHP said that the Mental Health Act (MHA) assessment was put on. RIO system for Hampshire NHS staff, and could be made available to general practice or prison healthcare on request, but was not automatically transferred. There was a need for a national process of information sharing. ´) The Custody Advisor informs the court that the national system was that the Detained Person's Medical Forms (DPMF) were routinely scanned onto the police RMS system, but the Mental Health Act Assessment isnot. The logic was not apparent, as both would appear to have the same quality of confidence. ´) Medical in confidence information from police stations was sometimes transmitted in sealed envelopes marked Confidential, traveling with the prisoner, but the independent psychiatric expert thought that this was the least effective form of communication and recommended that the assessing team should communicate with the next stage inthe process, such as contacting the catchment area forensic service by phone out of hours, advising thatthe prisoner is likely to {30 0 a particular court, and writing a letter with the assessment in office hours, The Police Custody Advisor said that he would not expect the Mental Health Act Assessment report to routinely go tothe court or prisons with the Prisoner Escort Record (PER), unless the prisoner was sectioned. The logic for this was also not clear, as the non sectioned patient was more at risk of not having appropriate mental health care from non communication, than the sectioned one. ©) No report or letter oF appropriate communication about the MHA assessment vas completed in the police station to subsequent health care providers, nor was there asjstem to require it There was no evidence that the police doctor (FME) and police nurses notes, called Detained Person's Medieal Forms (DPMFS) were ever seen by anyone with responsibilty for Mr Walsh in Highdown or Belmarsh prisons, nor evidence of any established process of transfer ofthe information. Prison staff said that medical in confidence information can be seanned to prison health care, but there was not an established system of securing medical records from police stations {) The Pre-Release risk assessment was completed by a custody officer, indicating that the deceased had no risks. The Custody Advisor indicated that the officer did not appear to understand the sytem, as this particular questionnaire in the ceustody record should not have been completed for transfer to court. But it appeared that its negative entries may have misled others assessing risk at time of transfer 1) The completion of the PER in the police station did not reflect the contents of the custody record or custody log, fling to record his attempt to commit suicide by dehydration, his delusions, his obsession, or that he had been assessed as high tisk of suicide, The Custody Advisor sai that the system was meant to be that the PER was signed off by the custody officer, who should have known that the information was incorrect. ') The police staff completing the PER indicated she routinely did this without consultation with the custody log or custody record, which was not required, although the Custody Advisor informed the court that this was not meant to be the sytem. {) The care plan atthe police station which was recorded in detail in the custody record (and is meant to record any rsks and evidence of mental illness) was not sent onwards with the PER, not was the section on the PER marked Care Plan completed asthe Custody Advisor informed itshould be. Staff informed the 1a Staff a the fist night centre assessment at HMP Highdown saw the basic information about his offence andl recent history and the police national computer printout with no markers, although a subsequent one was found with markers, indicating a previous attempt in custody to hang himself in custody and a theeat to stab anyone who takes his children. There was no explanation for a false negative being ent. Deis not clear ifthe nurse doing the health screen at HMP Highdown was shown ot looked at the PER from the police tation, 1m) It is not cleat whether the nurse assessing health fitness for segregation in HMP Highdown by completing a proforma, did consult the System One Medical Records, but the nurse agreed that he had no information on the prisoner's behaviour and health in the police station, nor over the preceding four weeks, which he needed, and that he expected the reception nurse to ring information, +o him and it was not for him to go to Reception to get it. 18) The PER completed at HMP Highdown did not even reflect the limited information they had received from the police station three days earlier, It recorded no current health risks although the previous PER from the police station had indicated ron compliance with MHA assessment and depression, GP letter received reported a previous overdose in February and the decision had been made in reception that he needed mental health in reach service. The health care officer just recorded ""fit for transfer"" (0) The prison officer conducting the first night centre assessment in HMP Belmarsh did not see ot consider the PER from police station to HMP Highdown, three days previously. He did know he had a serious charge coming Lup for sentence and had no family support and was going to be isolated for 23 Ye hours a day in a single cell. He did not know he was depressed and on antidepressants, and if he had he would have opened an ACTT. Yet this information was known to health care staff. He reports thatthe nurse told him of no concerns and he told her of none, 1p) Iewas not apparent chat the first night nurse assessment in HMP Belmatsh [knew of or included consideration of his status on a úduty care egimeù, which isolated him for is protection from other inmates. The nurse did not feel there was time nor was it his job to review the medical records. He completed his proforma recording what the prisoner replied, even though he had information that it may be untrue and did not regard it was his job to record or reconcile differences 4) The reception GP assessment in HMP Belmarsh did not consider his status isolated on a úduty care regimeù although agreed it was risk factor, nor had any knowledge of hs behaviour inthe police station or see any relevant information from PNomis or discipline staff 1) The GP doing the GP assessment in HMP Belmarsh informed the court that there was insufficient time in his job to review the inmate medical records. He agreed thatthe records showed that suicide sx isk factors listed in Early Days in Custody were present ~ recent change in circumstance, transfer another establishment, violent offence, history self harm and suicide, potentially category Aand history of mental illness and drug or alcool problems. He had neither been informed of these factors nor identified them from the records and so neither opened an ACCT nor referred him to a peychiatrist. ´) He was referred to the MH in-reach team by the nurse. That team reviewed his medical records, showing a history of alcohol abuse and depression on treatment (hich did noe apparently include any from the police station, which the peychiatrst said he does not routinely see) and were reassured by his not being followed up by a psychiatrist in the community after a previous psychiatric admission, andl by his presentation not raising any concerns for almost all the doctors anid nurses, who had scen him in prisons. They did not see any PERS, and was not informed he was being isolated in a úduty of care regime * for 23 %8 hours a day, nor that the victims were children. The decision not to conduct a psychiatric assessment would have been different if he had seen the PERs or DPMEFs or MHA assessment, of his in patient psychiatric notes. 1) The indepenclent psychiatrist gave an opinion that the loss of key information was a particular concern as people move in and out of custody so that there was a potential that information would be lost to the civilian GP. Whilst some onganizations had taken a number of steps to minimize the risks to the live of others, particular the development of a national PER, others had only awoken tothe risks in the closing days ofthe inquest. Virgin Health Care chose not to attend, Southern Health and Oxleas NHS Trust submitted plans to prevent fature deaths before the inquest concluded. Hampshire Constabulary reported changes in traning and staff awareness. Hampshire County Council prepared a short document of proposed actions, but it was not available as evidence as it was received by the court after the conclusion of the evidence. The evidence taken as a whole, sugested that there was a breakdown of communication at every professional and organisational interface, 18 of which ae illustrated above. There was no agreed system for transfer of health care information from police station. cout, of from either to prison. There was no functioning and consistent sytem of passing risk information from one detained organization to another. There was not agreement whether there just was a duty to pass the information or i ft was not in possession, whether there was also one to ask for it and ifso which individual bore that responsibility. There appeared to be a focus by individuals on. completing the proforma or questionnaire required by the system, by rote with either no time to consider the whole person, or no sense tha it was their esponsibility to consider missing or discordant information orto be proactive in communicating gaps in knowledge or concerns. From the evidence of a number of, witnesses, the pattern of communication was not exceptional in this instance but reflected what usually happened. 2. That the standard of Mental Health Act assessments by these individuals needs tobe improved, and, given al three were in complete agreement, that also training. and provision for MHA assessments in police stations more widely may need to be reviewed. 6 3.

S17 leave is prescribed by the Responsible Medical Officer as part ofthe teatment to the hospitalised patient inorder facitate them re-ntegrating back ito the community in 2 siructured, safe an√© supported way. Typically this would start off wih escorted leave in the grounds ofthe hospital and hospital local, movin fo unescoried leave and then to home leave. Latterly the community mental heath services and Home Treatment Team are involved to ensure a smooth Wansition ofthe patent back to community living, \When Me Knights mental health deteriorated whilst on leave, there were concerns that a limited sk assessment was carried out by Cygnet Hospital prior to S17 leave on 21"" May 2015 and there was no communication wih the local community mental heath team and Home Treatment Team in Cornwall noiying them ofthe leave. This meant that when Mc Krights mental heath deteriorated while on leave, there was no method of reducing the risk of seltharm or harm to others, as no migation plan had been put in place in advance of he leave and the Cornwall Community Mental Health Team and the Home Treatment Team were unaware he was on S17 leave in ther area. The expert pychiarsts considered that athough misjudgement about leave could occur in any hospital setting, the fact that Mr Knight was being reated out of County would have increased the ek of poor communication with the communiy Weatment teams asthe pla wou ot be ama in cal sere and was very ney et ha veanng ont gh ct î The weatment of mental heath patents generally includes the involvement of significant family, iends and pels. On Mr Knights previous hospital admissions, his parents and dog has boon considered a significant protected factersin preventing him sell-harming and also aided in his recovery. Cygnet Hospital was a Shou dive fom Mr Knight and his parents home. This made it dificult to physically and practically arrange S17 leave and visiting by famiyfriends. There was also the cost of financing the visits. It was not possible (as on other admissions) due to the distance, for his dog fo be Included nthe eotnen i racers A he inquest the Consultant Psychiatrists (including Expert Psychiatrist) gave evidence that it was not best practice to reat patients out of county. This was particulary relovant to patent with chronic mental heath issues (as wih Mr Knigh) where they were well known tothe local mental heath service and the needs and issue had successhuly been addressed inthe past úAnother issues raised, was the cfculies ofthe dial Ofee to adequately carry out ther statutory function at such distances.

Governor HMP Pentonville Caledonian Road London N7 8TT 3. Mr Michael Spurr Chief Executive National Offender Management Service Clive House 70 Petty France London SW1H 9EX,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. I list the MATTERS OF CONCERN below, though I am conscious that some of these have now been the subject of remedial action. Person Escort Record 1. The person escort record (PER) and appended report of the forensic medical examiner (FME) that accompanied Mr Kahssay to HMP Pentonville did not accompany him to nurse reception screening. Circumstances of the Index Offence 2. The index offence is recorded on the PER (and inputted onto the prison computer system NOMIS, though not the healthcare computer system SystmOne), but not the circumstances. The circumstances ì perhaps from the indictment read out in court ì may be potentially helpful to healthcare and possibly also to discipline staff in prison. This is not clear cut, because the logistics of obtaining the information and making it available to those who need it are complex; prosecutions must not be compromised; and there is the potential for making a prisonerôs mental state worse by probing the circumstances. However, it seems that this is an issue that is worthy of consideration, preferably at a national level. General Practitioner Records 3. The general practitioner records were never obtained (an issue that I have raised in the past), despite there being a system in place for Pentonville healthcare administrative staff to do this. Whilst that did not impact upon Mr Kahssayôs care, it might for another prisoner. 3 Nurse Reception Screening 4. The first reception screen template contained questions that carried an inherent ambiguity, in that they related to a change in personal and family circumstances, which must always be the case when a person is incarcerated and therefore does not assist in determining which prisoners are at an increased risk. (I did hear at inquest that any prisoner on a charge of murder will now be the subject of a psychiatric assessment.) 5. Both nurses conducting reception screening talked often in evidence about not being able to do anything other than accept the answers given by the prisoner. They did not seem to bring any objective analysis to the screening. The process of nurse screening appeared at times to be a tick box exercise. 6. The second reception (well man) screening nurse did not explore the history of depression recorded, he said because the prison general practitioner had not prescribed any medication for depression. On reflection, the nurse thought that he should have asked about it. Resuscitation 7. The resuscitation led by the two nurses occupying the positions of primary (Hotel 7) and secondary (Hotel 12) leads for emergency healthcare in the prison that night, was significantly lacking in the following ways. ÔÇ∑ The nurse with primary responsibility for emergency care in the prison did not have a proper understanding of the nature of a code red and a code blue prison medical emergency. (I have raised this issue in the past.) ÔÇ∑ One minute and twelve seconds elapsed after nurse arrival before any substantive care was given. The action during that one minute and twelve seconds did not appear to progress the resuscitation attempt. ÔÇ∑ There seemed no clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities during the resuscitation. Of course these may change as those giving resuscitation tire, but the changes seemed haphazard. ÔÇ∑ There was no checking for breath or airway manoeuvre at the outset or at any time during the resuscitation. ÔÇ∑ There was no checking for pulse at the outset, before commencing chest compressions, or at any time during the resuscitation. 4 The lead nurse attempted to justify this by saying that she had not wanted to waste time. This was despite the first action upon finding the casualty being to apply a blood pressure cuff, on the basis that this was part of the nurse assessment. ÔÇ∑ When giving evidence, the lead nurse appeared to conflate the casualty who is in cardiorespiratory arrest with the casualty who is merely unconscious. She repeatedly talked about the need to give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to an unconscious casualty. She said that, at the time she started chest compressions, she did not know whether Mr Kahssay was breathing or not breathing. ÔÇ∑ When CPR was given, chest compressions were ineffective, being too quick and too shallow. ÔÇ∑ There was only one brief attempt to use an ambubag, the majority of the resuscitation taking place without airway assistance or with a non rebreathe oxygen mask. ÔÇ∑ It appeared that one oxygen cylinder was empty, as it had to be changed for another. The nurse leading the resuscitation described it as chaotic. That is indeed how it appeared to me from her description and from viewing the bodycam footage. I was and remain very gravely concerned, not in this respect for Mr Kahssay who was in fact already dead when resuscitation commenced, but for anyone else in the prison in need of first aid."

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:- 1. The ACCT document was not completed fully, did not accompany Liam around the prison as it should have and not all appropriate individuals were invited to the reviews. Available documentary information was not read or used, and pressures of time were cited to explain these failings. Consideration should be given to formally confirming that all necessary documentation has been considered prior to the ACCT review, and to ensure the Officers and Healthcare staff are aware of their responsibilities. 2. This ACCT was only open for a short period. It did not serve Liam's needs properly and was closed before any review system picked up the inadequacies. 3. The Governor provided evidence that resourcing was affecting the ability of officers to carry out their duties regarding keeping prisoners safe from self harm. In this particularly vulnerable population of young men, their safety is paramount and this should be the first consideration.

The GP felt bound to follow the advice given seemingly without appreciating that prescribing was his responsibility and with it the obligation to advise the patient about the medication. 2. The trust acknowledges that it would be inappropriate for non psychiatrist members of staff to be advising GPs on medication and that this must be communicated to all staff. 3. Edward received no advice about the contraindications of the medication and critically that he may well feel worse before he felt better and may feel more suicidal. In either event he should have been told who to call to get further assistance. 4. The fact that Edward did not receive this information could be due to there being no clear sense of who would be responsible for his care pending further mental health team appointments. 5. did not appear to appreciate that he could ask to speak with a consultant psychiatrist if he had any concerns and wanted to discuss any aspect of care or treatment. 6. Apparently all GPs should have been made aware by the CCG that there is a duty psychiatrist with whom they can speak but according to the trust many GPs remain unaware of this. 6 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 07 November 2016. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

Secretary of State for Health,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì The seriousness of the deceasedôs condition was realised whilst the deceased was at HMP Durham although probably initially misdiagnosed. During a hypomanic episode which lasted a number of weeks the deceased was for a time left in a urine soaked cell, drinking and washing from the cell toilet at a time when he needed specialist hospital treatment. The evidence showed that his illness was not properly addressed. At HMP Durham a psychiatric referral for the purpose of compiling a care plan, including a plan for therapeutic medication was never completed and he was transferred to HMP Haverigg without any steps being taken to plan health care for the future, take action to avoid a recurrence of his illness or identify and deal with a relapse should one occur. At HMP Haverigg there was inadequate mental health cover with at times only one mental 1 2 health nurse and no provision for psychiatric referral. He was transferred to HMP Kirkham. A lack of suitable psychiatric care facilities at HMP Kirkham (among other things) led to a transfer to HMP Risley, where due to inadequacies of care planning and communication deficits which had been a feature of the deceasedôs care whilst in prison, the fact that the deceased was relapsing into depression was not recognised. The jury concluded that the deceasedôs death by hanging was partly due to deficiencies in mental health care and failure to properly observe ACCT procedures."

Despite the fact that there had been a clear change in the presentation of úTracey Lynch folowing the CPA Meeting on the 22% June and despite the fact that arrangements for discharge were not in place unt the 26∞ September 2015 no final discharge meeting was held, that is despite the fact that the responsible clinician the care co-ordinator | land the deputy manager fom Oswald House KE hoc at Indicated that they wished for thereto be afral discharge meeting. There seemed to be no System in pace to ensure that such a meeting would take place and in order to ensure that appropriate management would take place (ofthe dscharge toa rehabltation unt 2. The evidence was that femilarsation vis would have been of considerable assistance to Miss Lynch inthe lead up to her discharge to Osweld House. Despite that being accepted there appeared to be no system in place to ensure that such famiiarsation visits woul take place. 3. The evdence wos hat I tne mother of Tracey Lynch, had alerted the care co-ordinator and the responsible cincan with her concerns | that her daughter's state of mind was such that unless she was propery and appropriately escorted in the transport from The Harbour to Oswald | House that she would attempt to jump from the motor vehide. Those concerns were not addressed such that on the 28∞ September wien only escorted by the occupational therapist who was driving the vehicle Miss Lynch was able to grab the stering wheel and cause a serious acident on the MSS motorway. Despte the fact tat that risk had previously been identified there was no attempt to seek to manage that nan appropriate way. 4. Having been detained by the Police and having then been assessed by Mental Heath Practitioners Tracey Lynch was then detained under Section 3 | of the Mental Heath Act 1963, She was taken from Preston Police Station to The Harbour at Blackpool.

He was clearly a young man with some insight and some complex mental health issues, and the freseting offences and behaviour, longstanding in his case, for which he had been convicted was a form of behaviour, according to the forensic psychologss' report, that could, in some cases, have a significant underying psychological component.

""ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths. it goes without saying that no eicism is implied or intended of Steven's indeterminate sentence isl, and there was also evidence of good quality mental health care having been provided to Steven previously while he was in prison. However, was clear from evidence gen that IPPôs have now been stopped, and it also likely fo be the case that there are other potentially vulnerable priconere tke Steven who are stil on IPP's within the prison system and at signifcant sk of continuing self harm after serving their tai, fring themselves in a systom where the Parole Board hearings that provide the only possible means by which they could be released are infrequent, only occuring two or three years.

https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/ahmedreza-fathi/,2016-0173,5/5/2016,Default value,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. I list the MATTERS OF CONCERN below, though I am conscious that some of these have now been the subject of remedial action. Person Escort Record 1. The person escort record (PER) and appended report of the forensic medical examiner (FME) that accompanied Mr Kahssay to HMP Pentonville did not accompany him to nurse reception screening. Circumstances of the Index Offence 2. The index offence is recorded on the PER (and inputted onto the prison computer system NOMIS, though not the healthcare computer system SystmOne), but not the circumstances. The circumstances ì perhaps from the indictment read out in court ì may be potentially helpful to healthcare and possibly also to discipline staff in prison. This is not clear cut, because the logistics of obtaining the information and making it available to those who need it are complex; prosecutions must not be compromised; and there is the potential for making a prisonerôs mental state worse by probing the circumstances. However, it seems that this is an issue that is worthy of consideration, preferably at a national level. General Practitioner Records 3. The general practitioner records were never obtained (an issue that I have raised in the past), despite there being a system in place for Pentonville healthcare administrative staff to do this. Whilst that did not impact upon Mr Kahssayôs care, it might for another prisoner. 3 Nurse Reception Screening 4. The first reception screen template contained questions that carried an inherent ambiguity, in that they related to a change in personal and family circumstances, which must always be the case when a person is incarcerated and therefore does not assist in determining which prisoners are at an increased risk. (I did hear at inquest that any prisoner on a charge of murder will now be the subject of a psychiatric assessment.) 5. Both nurses conducting reception screening talked often in evidence about not being able to do anything other than accept the answers given by the prisoner. They did not seem to bring any objective analysis to the screening. The process of nurse screening appeared at times to be a tick box exercise. 6. The second reception (well man) screening nurse did not explore the history of depression recorded, he said because the prison general practitioner had not prescribed any medication for depression. On reflection, the nurse thought that he should have asked about it. Resuscitation 7. The resuscitation led by the two nurses occupying the positions of primary (Hotel 7) and secondary (Hotel 12) leads for emergency healthcare in the prison that night, was significantly lacking in the following ways. ÔÇ∑ The nurse with primary responsibility for emergency care in the prison did not have a proper understanding of the nature of a code red and a code blue prison medical emergency. (I have raised this issue in the past.) ÔÇ∑ One minute and twelve seconds elapsed after nurse arrival before any substantive care was given. The action during that one minute and twelve seconds did not appear to progress the resuscitation attempt. ÔÇ∑ There seemed no clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities during the resuscitation. Of course these may change as those giving resuscitation tire, but the changes seemed haphazard. ÔÇ∑ There was no checking for breath or airway manoeuvre at the outset or at any time during the resuscitation. ÔÇ∑ There was no checking for pulse at the outset, before commencing chest compressions, or at any time during the resuscitation. 4 The lead nurse attempted to justify this by saying that she had not wanted to waste time. This was despite the first action upon finding the casualty being to apply a blood pressure cuff, on the basis that this was part of the nurse assessment. ÔÇ∑ When giving evidence, the lead nurse appeared to conflate the casualty who is in cardiorespiratory arrest with the casualty who is merely unconscious. She repeatedly talked about the need to give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to an unconscious casualty. She said that, at the time she started chest compressions, she did not know whether Mr Kahssay was breathing or not breathing. ÔÇ∑ When CPR was given, chest compressions were ineffective, being too quick and too shallow. ÔÇ∑ There was only one brief attempt to use an ambubag, the majority of the resuscitation taking place without airway assistance or with a non rebreathe oxygen mask. ÔÇ∑ It appeared that one oxygen cylinder was empty, as it had to be changed for another. The nurse leading the resuscitation described it as chaotic. That is indeed how it appeared to me from her description and from viewing the bodycam footage. I was and remain very gravely concerned, not in this respect for Mr Kahssay who was in fact already dead when resuscitation commenced, but for anyone else in the prison in need of first aid."

I appreciate that care must be taken not to override a patientôs autonomy, but it might be useful for staff routinely to consider whether they are able to obtain feedback from family members after such leave. 3. There appears to be confusion about whether a doctor is needed to authorise unplanned leave of an informal patient (not relevant in this case because the leave had already been authorised). Your serious incident review of this matter indicates that this is necessary, but I heard evidence that such medical authorisation is not routinely sought. 4. Substandard documentation in the nursing records had already been identified before the inquest by your serious incident review. Without improvement in the records, it is not possible to determine whether and if so by whom a necessary risk assessment is undertaken, e.g. immediately before weekend leave is taken."

Barts and the London 1. Whilst it was clear to me from the evidence I heard at inquest that Barts and the London, both in terms of certain individuals within it and as an organisation, took its pastoral responsibilities very seriously indeed and made great efforts to support this student, there was one aspect of their processes that I think would benefit from review. The decision that Ms Chanthirakumar could re-take the fourth year of her medical degree was seen by the medical school as a helpful decision. The re-take was allowed on the basis of her ill health and was not a criticism of her academic achievement. That she would not be able to take her fourth year examinations in August 2015 came to be regarded as almost self evident, because she had not been able to attend the majority of her recent clinical placement and had been so recently so unwell. However, unbeknown to the university staff, Ms Chanthirakumar appears to have lacked some insight at this point, and was actually hoping not to have to re-take the year, but instead to take her fourth year exams in August 2015. 3 Given the very particular course of very recent events leading up to the medical schoolôs decision, I wonder whether a personal meeting to discuss matters with her could have been arranged, rather than communicating this by email. A face to face meeting may not necessarily have had any impact on the outcome, but nevertheless I think would be a helpful consideration for the process in the future. East London Trust 2. After the medical school was alerted to Ms Chanthirakumarôs illness by two of her friends on 17 June 2015, a senior lecturer working in student support services (and, as it happens, herself a general practitioner) rang Globe Ward of Mile End Hospital and spoke to a treating nurse. Her intention in making this call was to deliver information, most specifically to relay concerns that Ms Chanthirakumar was not being wholly open with staff about the extent of her distress. However, such was the ward nurseôs anxiety not to breach patient confidentiality, the conversation was not as meaningful or as productive as it might otherwise have been. It seems to me that nurses and doctors working in mental health particularly, would benefit from a reminder of the difference between absorbing (and, if appropriate, acting upon) concerns raised by a patientôs relatives, friends, tutors etc., and divulging a patientôs private details. In addition, it may well be that a piece of self reflection has already been undertaken by the mental health team caring for Ms Chanthirakumar, taking into account the fact that she took her own life so soon after her discharge from a period of inpatient treatment, and with her university being unaware of her own expectation that she would be able to take her exams in August 2015. It seems that such reflection might usefully inform future practice."

At the time of his death he was using illicit drugs and úlegal highsù which were purchased over the internet, which on balance contributed to his state of mind. I retumed a conchision thet the deceased had taken his own life. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH The Court heard evidence that Jake was a young man for whom his family had had no concems until approximately 12 months prio to his death. Following the death of a family member in 2013 there had been a deterioration in Jake's behaviour and be had also lost alot of weight. In January 2015 Jake was scen by mental health services (RAID) and a referral was made to Phoenix Futures young person drug and alcohol service. He developed a good relationship with his Substance Misuse worker from this service. It was known that Jake was buying significant illicit benzodiazepine over the intemet. In 2015 Jake also presented on three occasions tothe Accident & Emergency Department, three of| these occasions were due to self harm attempts and suicidal thoughts including 0n two occasions in April and twice on the 9* and 17∞ July 2015 when he had tied a ligature around his neck and taken an overdose, An attendance in March 2015 was due toa seizure. On each occasion it was felt that his drug use was the primary difculty and he was referred back tothe substance misuse services, Although Phoenix Futures were the drug service engaged with Jake they have no ability to preseribe medication so a referral was made to Trafford AIM a Community Drugs and Aleohol Service. Due to the seizure in March Jake had required further investigations, this meant that he was not able to be prescribed Diazepam (which it was recognised he required in order to be detoxed from his illicit benzodiazepine use). He had. received a short course from his GP in 20"" march until the 29 April A referal had been made for Jake to be seen by the Community Mental Health Team but the appointment made was at the same time on the 19"" August as he had an appointment with the Trafford Aim Service. Jake was advised to arrange his appointment with the CMHT ~ the Court did not hear any evidence to explain why the decision was taken to rearange the CMHT appointment as opposed to the appointment with Trafford Aim. The appointment was rearranged. forthe 28∞ August, 5 days after Jake died. CORONERS CONCERNS Theconcems noted by the Court during the couse ofthe Inquest areas follows: 1) The Court heard evidence, that his GP had writen to Greater Manchester West on the 23∞ June 2015 (exactly to whom this leter was addressed is not known as it was not provided in the evidence from the GP practice) indicating that Jake could be prescribed iazepam following the investigation for his seizure. There was no indication in the by GM West as to whether this letter had been reotived and if not why not. However neither of the Drug. Services who were involved with Jake were aware ofthis information and therefore he was not commenced on any benzodiazepine eduction. This issue is being brought to the attention of all the recipients ofthis Regulation 28 report including the Medical Director forthe Greater Manchester NHS Area who will be aware of the same concer raised ina separate recent case. 2) The failure to identify the above issue as part of the review into the √©eath of Jake Robinson is a concem as it highlights ´ missed opportunity to potentially lean lessons, 3) The fact that Phoenix Futures have no ability to prescribe medication Ao their services users was a concer. Itmean hat young people with substance misuse isues have to be refered t Trafford Aim, who are 8 service for people over the age of 26. Jake had a good relationship with Phoenix Futures but he did siugsle to engage with services ""The fact that be then ad to engage with two services added to what in the Courts view was a disconnected approach to dealing with Jakes increasing difficulties. 4) There was no explanation in the review as to why the appointment clash between Trafford Aim and the Community Mental Health Team, Jed tothe appointment with the CMHT being rearranged. Particularly as Jake had made two recent serious attempts of self-harm in July 12015 and was at the very least recognised as a high risk of accidental self-harm. Given that Trafford Aim were not prescribing Jake at this time the Court had some difficulties in understanding what their role was given that he was also under Phoenix Futures for his substance ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Ihave the power to take such action. It should be noted that both ofthe medical practices involved inthis particular case had themselves noted flaws in the systems and taken steps to address some ofthe issues themselves, however the findings of the Court highlight an issue which may impact on medi across Manchester.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Piotr Kucharz was a Polish gentleman who commenced living in the United Kingdom in April 2014. At the time he sought to strangle himself with a cord he was an informal patient at the Conway Ward at Parkwood, a mental health facility in Blackpool. At his inquest, evidence was heard from a number of members of staff as regards what constitutes an effective observation. He was the subject of what were described as Safety and Security [SAS] and general observations the completion of which was the responsibility of a number of members of care staff. The evidence heard from staff raised an area of concern because that evidence indicated quite clearly that there was a lack of consistency and clarity as regards what constitutes an effective observation. An independent expert witness indicated in a report that he completed prior to the inquest that he felt custom and practice was such that some staff were merely checking on the úwhereaboutsù of the patient. Some staff felt that they were expected to enter the room of the patient and to try to engage with him and to check the room environment for anything that may pose a risk to him. Others felt that whether they were expected to actually enter a patientôs room to conduct the observation could vary depending on the level of risk a particular patient presented, in other words that they felt they had an element of discretion as regards whether they entered the room. This evidence appeared to be in contrast to a Trust policy. In the case of Piotr Kucharz, as can be seen above he had limited understanding of English, and a number of staff gave evidence that he remained in his room throughout his time on the Conway Ward and did not wish to engage with them. Nevertheless, the author of the Trustôs Sudden Untoward Incident Review document agreed that there was no such discretion and that staff ought to enter the room to complete and effective observation. At the conclusion to the inquest I expressed the view that I was concerned that there is a risk of future deaths because staff remain unclear about what amounts to an effective observation, and more specifically whether there are circumstances which may allow them to refrain from verbally engaging with a patient, or from physically entering a patientôs room to check the environment, and that should that lack of consistency and clarity prevail, other patients may be placed at risk as a result of inadequate observations. 2 3 For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that I am of the opinion that the above concern remains valid despite the fact that further to Piotr Kucharzôs death the provision of mental health care for patientôs such as Piotr has moved from the Conway Ward at Parkwood to another facility within my jurisdiction at which members of staff who were working at the time of Piotrôs death continue to be employed in a similar capacity."

The Chief Executive, Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust CORONER 1am Bridget Dolan, assistant coroner, forthe coroner area of West Sussex. CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS make this eport under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, ofthe Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 ofthe Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. INVESTIGATION and INQUEST (On 25 November 2014 the Senior Coroner commenced an investigation into the death Cf Mrs Wanda Stachurska The investigation concluded atthe end of the inguest on 20 May 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, the medical eause of death being hanging, CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On 16 November 2014 Mrs Stachurska was brought by ambulance to the Emergency Department (ED) of East Surrey Hospital (managed by Surrey and Sussex Healtheate NHS Trust SASH). She had been found hat day by a member of the public having taken an overdose of 30 sleeping tablets and was atempting to hang herself from a Didge. She was also hypothermic from immersing herself i the cold water of a brook. She informed the ambulance erew that she had been úeying to commit suicideô Mrs Stachurska stayed overnight in the hospital and the following morning she again expressed úsuicidal intentù to the ED consultant. At around 17.00 hours that afternoon she was assessed in the ED by mental health nurse from Surrey and Borders Partnership [NHS Foundation Trust (SABP). That nurse noted Mrs Stachurska now denied suicidal feelings. She considered that there was a low risk of se harm and hence Mrs Stachurska was dicharged home at around 19.00 hours, The nurse did not ascettain that Mrs Stachurska had attempted to selfligature atthe beidge the previous day, although this information had been handed over orally by the ambulance staff to the ED triage nurse The mental health nurse stated that had she known this information it would have been relevant to er tsk assessment Mrs Stachurska was discovered deceased at around 09.00 the following moming, 18 November 2014, having hanged herself from a tree ina park not fat from her home, Mes Stachurska was Polish and had limited command of English, hence hee assessment Dy the mental health nurse had to be Tacltated through an interpreter. The nurse considered it was important (0 observe the patient's interaction and non-verbal cues heough a face-to-face interpreter, The relevant SASH policy was úto only use interpreters who are bilingually competent, neutral, independent and professionally trained and qualifiedù and that úthe use of staff is not acceptable unless there are exceptional circumstancesù (eg emergency situations). The mental health nurse stated that this was not an emergency situation. She also stated that she was not awa of the SH. policy as although she was based at the Fast Surrey Hospital, where she understood SASH policies would apply, she was not equited to be familiar with SASH policies because she was an employee of SABP. The interpreter who was then provided to her by SASH was a Polish man who was employed by a sub-contractor and worked as a security guard atthe hospital. The nurse's experience was thatthe provision of a staff member as a face-to-face interpreter was the orm rather than an exceptional occurrence. It appeared from the nurse's account that the provision of the security guard as an interpreter was sub-optimal in that, although he endeavoured to assist, he did not always directly translate but rather reported a theme of what was being sid. ""Her view was that using a professional interpreter may have improved the quality of hee assessment and lowed her to gain more understanding of the nuances of what the patient was saying. Additionally, she stated that if an interpreter had been provided to her who was at least a health care professional this would have been better, because that person would have had more understanding of terms and terminology and the reasons for the assessment. She had in the past completed mental health assessments using members of elnial staff which she had found preferable, Furthermore, it was apparent that the secusity guard later discussed some information about the paticat with another person. It should be noted dha although he had been asked by SASH to act asa translator for Polish patients on several other occasions the man had not been given any tnining or guidance by SASH in respect of how he should carry out this tole and the nurse said that he had not been informed about clinical confidentiality in respect ofthis particular assessment. [No serious incident report of review of this death has been conducted by either Trust involved. The mental health nurse had learned of the death from her line manager who she considered was responsible for reporting the incident and could give no explanation swhy this grade Iù serious incident under the SABP policy had not been the subject of SABP SI review, The ED consultant was of the opinion that a serious incident eview was not required under the SASH policy because he believed there had been 0 omissions of shortcomings in the clinical care provided by SASH. CORONER'S CONCERNS Ducing the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there sa sik that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. I am conscious that some matters are already being addressed, but I think it would nevertheless be helpful to set out my concerns below. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Camden and Islington Trust 1. It seemed from the evidence I heard that the Camden and Islington Trust psychiatry liaison team (doctor and nurse) operating at Whittington Hospital on the night of 15 November 2015, were not wholly clear about the protocols for receipt of information from police officers bringing patients into hospital on a voluntary basis. 2. The team then saw a patient without waiting to obtain the triage record created by Whittington Hospital Trust staff. 3. The doctor did not ask Ms Martin about thoughts of suicide within the context of her earlier declaration that she would die that night. 4. He did not ask her about any thoughts of harming another person, regardless of the fact he was not aware that she had threatened this. 5. He did not address his mind to what had led up to the police being called for Ms Martin, nor who had called them. 3 6. Neither doctor nor nurse obtained a collateral history of events from a family member before concluding their interview with Ms Martin. 7. When they obtained this afterwards and then realised that Ms Martin had left the hospital, they contacted the police but did not characterise this as an emergency. 8. The crisis team did not pass on information received from Ms Martinôs sister to the psychiatry liaison team with a sufficient degree of urgency to ensure that this was taken into consideration before the interview with Ms Martin was concluded. Whittington Hospital Trust 1. There seemed to be some degree of confusion surrounding the voluntary attendance of a patient with mental health needs accompanied by the police, that suggests a multi agency discussion and agreement would be beneficial. 2. I was told at inquest by Camden & Islington that the Whittington had been unable to locate the Whittington triage record of Ms Martinôs attendance, and I did not discover any record of the call made by Ms Martinôs sister to the emergency department that night. Metropolitan Police Service 1. The police call handler who spoke to Ms Martin did not record that she said: úI need to jump a balconyù. This was important information. 2. As I have indicated above, the confusion surrounding voluntary attendance of a patient with mental health needs accompanied by the police, suggests a multi agency discussion and agreement would be beneficial."

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 March 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was that Aleysha Martine Karta McLoughlin had commited Suicide, The medical cause of her death was 1a Hanging. | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH On the 15th of July 2008 a Care Order relating to Aleysha McLoughlin was made at Manchester County Court upon the application of Bolton Counc Aleysha was then placed with a family member, where she remained settled unt the 9th of September 2012 when she went to stay with her mother and refused to return, On the 8th of October Aleysha left her mother's address and although there was a short period thereafter when Aleysha retumed to live with her family member the placement broke down. Accordingly on the 26th of November 2012 Aleysha was placed with a foster carer where she remained ntl her death in April 2014. As the foster carer lived in a different area Aleyshe also changed schools, and at first she appeared to make a positive start at her new school. However from in or about March 2013 her schoolwork and behaviour began to deteriorate. LUkewise Aleysha appeared to settle well with her foster carer. However on the 13th of March 2013 she left her foster carerôs home and did not return until the 20th of March 2013. When asked where she had been Aleysha said that she hed been with her mother. In early June 2013 the head of Aleysha's year at school had a preventative meeting with her and her foster carer to address a perceived deterioration in Aleysha's behaviour. Aleysha did not engage at that meeting, and her behaviour was perceived to continue to be poor. (On or about the 8th of June 2013 Aleysha again left her foster carer's home and did not return until the 20th of June, on this occasion saying that she had been with her sister. (On the 25th of June 2013 whist Aleysha's sister was visiting her at her foster carer's home Aleysha reported to her carer that her sister had taken an overdose. The following evening, the 27th of June, Aleysha herself took an overdose of aspirin and paracetamol. She was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital where she initially refused treatment, and even after consenting she later removed the cannula administering intravenous medication and had to be persuaded to have it restored. During Aleysha's hospital admission clinicians from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) assessed her and a further appointment was made for her to see a CAMHS clinical psychologist after her discharge from hospital. On the Sth of July 2013 Alysha attended that appointment with her foster carer. Aleysha did not want any further involvement with CAMHS and as Aleysha's risk of further self harm was, for various reasons, believed to be reduced, it was decided that there was no ongoing role for CAMHS at that time, although an offer of re-referral was made should matters change. When Aleysha retumed to school after the summer holiday in September 2013, she was perceived as continuing to be uncooperative and dificult to engage. On a date between in or about October 2013 and at or about Christmas of 2013 one of the Social Workers involved with Aleysha was informed by Aleysha's foster carer that Aleysha had inflicted some superficial cuts upon herself. The social worker believed that this was a historical event and did not ask Aleysha about it (On the 7th of January 2014 Aleysha and her sister both took overdoses of asprin and they were taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital. Clinicians wanted to admit Aleysha to the hospital for observation because she was believed to have taken a potentially life threatening overdose, but Aleysha refused to be admitted. She was seen by a Doctor in the Accident and Emergency Department Of the Hospital, who decided that she had the capacity to refuse treatment and noted that she was discharged. Aleysha was subsequently seen by a Doctor specializing in mental health, who had concerns that Aleysha did not, in fact, have the capacity to refuse treatment. However medical staff would not then admit Aleysha to the hospital because a medical doctor had discharged her. Whilst discussions about this were continuing Aleysha left the hospital with her ster, who was also refusing treatment. Aleysha and her sister were retumed to the hospital the following moming, and @ mental health nurse who was a member of the Rapid Assessment Interface Discharge (RAID) team then assessed Aleysha. Aleysha continued to refuse to be admitted to hospital and was then assessed to have the capacity to make that decision. In the course of the assessment Aleysha told the mental health nurse that she had self- harmed by cutting herself, although she had not done that recently. That information was not passed to other agencies. Particularly it was not contained in the information subsequenty passed to CAMHS nor was it vento Social Services nor Aleysha's School. During the assessment Alysha stated that she dd not then want to end her life but that she had wanted to do so at the time when she had taken the overdose. tthe conclusion ofthe assessment It was <etermined that whist Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self harm she was at ongoing rsk of mpuisve se harm, and arrangements were made for her tO have an appointment with CAMHS, despite Alysha stating that she would not attend. Aleysha was also referred to the Safeguarding Children Team at the Royal Bolton Hosp. (On the 8th of January 2014 Aleysha was seen by her school nurse, who had been informed of her hospital attendance by the Safeguarding team. Aleysha dedined further support from the nurse, who did not then contact Aleysha again, On the 8th of February 2014 Aleysha and her sister were seen to be on the wrong side of the fencing of a road bridge where they were at risk of jumping or faling onto the carriageway below. Police Officers attended, and Aleysha walked off the bridge. She was then detained by the Police under the terms of the Mental Health Act and taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital, where she was seen by two Doctors specializing in psychiatry and an Approved Mental Health Professional who was a social worker, for the purpose of a Mental Health Act assessment. Aleysha did not fully engage during the assessment, and denied that she had intended to harm herself when she had been on the bridge. The assessment concluded that Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self-harm, but that she remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self-harm. Aleysha was then discharged from detention under the Mental Health Act. A further referral was made to the Safeguarding team and to CAMHS, although Aleysha again said that she would not attend at CAMHS, stating that she didn't need it. On the 11th of February 2014 a secretary working for the CAMHS team telephoned Aleysha and offered her an appointment with a mental health practitioner on the 17th of February, which Aleysha refused. On the 18th of February a social worker contacted a mental health nurse at CAMHS in order to share information regarding Aleysha particularly with regard to the events ofthe 8th of February described above. The ensuing discussion included an acknowledgement of the risks presented to Aleysha as @ consequence of her impulsive behaviour when she was with her sister. Aleysha's refusal to engage with CAMHS was also discussed and the Social Worker planned that Aleysha's foster carer should be contacted and asked to encourage Aleysha to attend an appointment with CAMHS. On the 25th of February a multi agency meeting was held by social services to address Aleysha's self harming behaviour and her refusal to engage with CAMHS. CAMHS were not invited to this, nor to any other meeting. It was agreed that in view of Aleysha's refusal to engage with mental health services her foster carer should receive some training as to means of promoting Aleysha's engagement with those services This training had not been put into place by the time of Aleysha's death on the 3rd of April 2014, (On the 6th of March 2014 Aleysha was excluded from school for five days due to her bad behaviour. A meeting took place with Aleysha and her foster carer and an individual programme of lessons was agreed, so as to support Aleysha during the period leading up to her forthcoming public examinations. (On the 2nd of April 2014 a pupil at Aleysha's schoo! told Aleysha's head of year that Aleysha had self-harmed by cutting her arms. Aleyshaôs socal worker and her foster carer were informed and when they saw Aleysha an ambulance was summonsed and Aleysha was taken tothe Royal Bolton Hospital with her foster carer following. When Aleysha was treated she was found to have twenty-nine recent lacerations on her let arm, together with scaring from older wounds. Neither Alesha's foster carer nor Social Services had previously been aware that Aleysha was self-harming to this level. Whilst Aleyshals wound were being closed the treating nurse asked Aleysha if she wanted to see anyone from the RAID team, but Aleysha declined. Despite this the nurse contacted the RAID team and 2 mental health nurse assessed Aleyshe. The assessment concluded that on this occasion Aleysha's se-harm was not an acute incident of attempted suicide but that Aleysha remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self-harm, The means of treating thi risk was ongoing psychological therapy such as was offered by CAMHS and the nurse conducting the assessment encouraged Alysha to attend CAMHS despite her expressed reluctance to do so. At about 3pm on the 3rd of April 2014 Aleysha was found deceased by her foster carer at thelr home address IIIT She had hanged herself. Prior to her death she had been researching websites relating to suicide and hanging. She had also taken amphetamine, which could have induced depression. (CORONER'S CONCERNS: During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concer. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action Is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: Evidence was given at the Inquest that self harm in young people is becoming a public health crisis. Evidence revealed that 3 out of 10 young people have self harmed at some time during their lives. Accordingly the matters of concem revealed were as follows:~ (1) That It should be considered that the system of training for those working with young people, including teachers, school nurses, foster carers, social workers, mental health workers and medical nurses and doctors should be reviewed so as to ensure that these professionals should be alert for signs of seif harm and should take opportunities to discover themselves so that those harming themselves can be offered help and support. By way of example evidence was given at the Inquest that the annual health check offered to looked after children did not include a blood pressure check. If a blood pressure check was included this would provide an opportunity for signs of self harm to be revealed. (2) That it should be considered that adaltional_information and encouragement could be offered to young people to inform those able to help for example teachers, nurses, health professionals etc. when a ""young person becomes aware that another young person is self harming The shocking self harm to which Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had subjected herself was only revealed when a school friend brought it to the attention of a teacher. There was no evidence that there was any system in place to encourage the passing of such information (3) That it should be considered that systems such as those now being developed in Bolton should be further developed so as to ensure that multi agency discussions involving all relevant agencies are held urgently for those at risk of self harm and particularly for those who do not engage. Evidence was given that meetings concerning Aleysha Martine Karle McLoughlin did not include the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services although evidence was given that their input would have been valuable. (4) That it should be considered that a particular pathway of help for young people who resist engagement should be developed. There was no evidence that any such formal pathway had been shared at the present time. (5) That a review of the capacity of the agencles involved in helping young people who are self harming to address those matters appropriately should be considered, ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì NOMS/SODEXO - ANTI-LIGATURE STRIPS ON CELL DOORS 1. The deceased was a design engineer and his sketches found after death in his cell set out diagrammatically how he deduced that the gap between the cell door and frame would allow a ligature to be threaded through and that a wedge could be created with paper pamphlets to prevent slippage of the ligature. 2. The risk of cell doors being used for ligature points is well known. In HMP Dovegate alone some years ago, there were 3 suicides close in time where the upper hinge was used as a ligature point. 3. However, whilst the current specification for cell door design now incorporates an anti- ligature strip, there is no retrofit programme in operation and thus, there are significant numbers of cell doors that do not meet the current standard. 4. The need to eradicate ligature points in cells has been the subject of recommendations in PPO reports in Northern Ireland (JOHN MARTIN GERARD KENNEWAY published 10.12 2009 at recommendation 10 and COLIN MARTIN BELL published 9.1.2009 at recommendation 9) and many Australian Coronial decisions and observations of Coroners in England and Wales in the old Rule 43 and the new Regulation 28 reports. 5. Further, this was the subject of detailed commentary in the paper produced by the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science (University College London) where it was recognised as being of paramount importance that there be removal of as many ligature points as possible in cells and that remedial action would need to be taken as quickly as possible before a new method spreads within and between establishments. 6. Evidence was given that the cost of a national retrofit programme for all doors being adapted with an anti-ligature strip to meet the new design would be a significant proportion of the current budget. However, given the particular vulnerability of prisoners on induction and remand wings, a retrofit of those cells doors on such wings not meeting the requirement would provide some protection and would be a measured response to those prisoners who are known to be at heightened risk. NOMS/SODEXO ì THE ACCT PROCESS 7. PSI 64/2011 and the Quick Time Learning Bulletin (issue 12 august 2012) which clarified opening an ACCT was the subject of much scrutiny. There seems to be no national pro forma document to guide staff through the process and document the decision making. By contrast, the Act 2 Care risk assessment in the Scottish prison system does provide a structured approach. A pro forma regime would have the 33 Thorpe Road, Peterborough, PE3 6AB Tel 01733 452275 | Fax 0870 238 4085 advantage of providing an audit trail and can be reviewed for training purposes if shortcomings emerge. 8. There appears to be on occasions an over reliance on assessment of current risk as emphasised in the QTLB of 2012 by considering demeanour and presentation at the reception stage. The PPO bulletin of March 2015 highlights deficiencies in this approach. There are known risk factors for suicide and self-harm and active identification of relevant risk factors from documentation and information (e.g. SASH forms and PERs and medical records and an FME report) should be fully considered and balanced against apparent mood so that the there is a comprehensive risk assessment.. A pro forma document could record what factors and documentation have been considered and the reasons for the decision. 9. It is known that a prisoners risk of self-harm and/or suicide may increase in certain circumstances. This applied to the deceased in this inquest. HMP Gartree have identified measures to identify potential triggers and there has been developed a database on trigger dates but only for those who are or have been subject to an ACCT. This could be refined to deal with re assessment of risk for many prisoners if key factors exist. (See Equality and Human Rights Commission paper in 2015 on Preventing Deaths in detention of adults with Mental Health Conditions). Again, the PPO bulletin of March 2015 highlighted increased vulnerability where a restraining order was made and this could be input into a database to prompt a review of risk. The deceased was served with papers concerning harassment whilst on remand that may have emphasised that his marriage was over and therefore increased vulnerability particularly when bail was subsequently refused and victim impact statements were referred to in court. 10. The PPO report recommended that an ACCT should be opened whenever a prisoner has recently self - harmed or expressed suicidal intent. NOMS ì HEALTHCARE SCREENING. 11. The healthcare screening which is a question and answer discussion based on specifically designed questions is prescriptive. It makes no mention of s.136 detentions which would be a clear indicator of enhanced risk and the deceased had two such detentions. SODEXO - ITEMS USED TO FACILITATE SUICIDE 12. Some prisoners at HMP Peterborough are allowed to carry their cell door key which is placed on shoelaces tied together and placed around the neck of the prisoner which clearly creates a self-made ligature for those who may be at risk. 13. In addition, the deceased referred to experimentation by suffocation in his diary by putting a plastic bag over his head and some cells are known to have plastic removable bin liners which can be used as a means to take life."

Following this, he came nto contact with the creinal justice system and committed a umber of offences, Ths also rstited in him serving several periods of mpeisonment In May 2011 he was arested after commiting a series of ottences. He also suered from substance misuse problems and had a history of self harm and suicidal keaton. He was transferred to HMP Preston, where he was seen by a Forensic Payehatrt, Dut 10 formal diagnostic impression of his mental health was made or recorded. The deceased was managed on an ACCT in HMP Preston since August 2011 He was, however, seen by a Consultant Psychiatrist who prepared a report forthe purposes of sentencing. This psychiatrist formed the opinion thatthe decoased was Suffering rom an artisocal personality disorder, a post-traumatic stress disordr, a mils depressive disorder and also a substance misuse dependence dsorder. He was transferred to HMP Manchester in November 2011 and was subject to ACCT procedures. He was admitted tothe Health Care Cerire ( HCC ) and was kopt ina sar al. In Apr'2012, the ACCT was dosed and he was translerre to an ordinary wing location. From about the middle of March 2012, he was voluntarily seeing a psychologist as pat La pot study in order to reduce the isk of se harm and sulclge. His sessions wih the psychologist ended on the Sth September 2012. Part of his therapy incuded cogrstve Behavioural therapy which he said he found hetplul. The psychologist gave evidence, and told he cour that she regarded his ciaims of being sexually abused as genuine and hat his presentation was entirely consistent wih that having occured, The court also received evidence ftom the lead Psychologist a he prison who confirmed that avery high proportion of prisoners wil suter rom personality sorders or traits of personaly disorders. Ho cid work witha tars but there wae a 5 or 6 month waiting list fr patient prisoner o See him. He only worked 1 day @ Week. However, during the period on ordinary location, he complained of being subject to {threats and intimidation and being called a grass. He had been moved from one wing to another. Despite this th appropriate ant socal behaviour document was nol opened despite the fact hal the Warily of one oF more ofthe alaged porpetraiors was dentied, This id not appear tobe accordance wih HMPS procedures. (On 6m September 2012 the deceased reported that he had taken an overdose of medication and was admitted to hosp for assessment, tests and observation. He was, elatively quickly discharged and inlay retumed tothe HCC. On or about 20th September, he was moved to another ordinary wing location, but discovered that one of the prisoners who had previously boon threatening him was now also on that wing. (On 26th September, he disclosed thoughts of active suicidal eation and inmociataly was seen and assessed by the wing manager. He was subject 1 a period of constant servations, in practical tems, before being moved eho HCC again and paced in a Safer cll He had previously sas that he could nat successfully harm himeelina ster cell A particularly unusual feature was that he ha no wish to be reieased from custody and regarded prison as home. Indeed, he described that he felt sae in prison. The Forensic Psychiatrist who carried out a clinical review thought that this was parieuary note worthy and not some thing he had encountered in 18 years. In the HCC, ho was subject to a2 man unlock, Unfortunately the cinial reviewer was unaware o his and only leamed the true position wien giving evidence at the inquest This means thatthe deceased could not be released rom his cll unless there Were wo members of staf! avaiable o supervise him at alltimes. In aden, the other prisoners {on the HCC had to be locked in thi calla whan he was outof his. He had described a setious and severe haired of paedophiles and that he would attack anyone who he garded as being one. This also meant that he was spending very coniderable| amounts of his time In his ea (On 231d October, a case conference was held. He had been seen on @ number of occasions (by a non-Consutant grade ) Psychiatrist who had begun to form the cinical Impression that he sutfered from a borderline personality disorder. It was fet hal there was no clinical justification for him silto remain onthe HCC. He was then seen for the frst and only time onthe 27 November 2012 by his Consutant Psychiatrist in charge of his care and management in HMP Manchester. This was n Conjunction with the oer less experienced Psychiatrist. The cncal record confirmed that he was on an unlock protocalin the HCC. During the assossmont, he sated that he wants to commit suicide and will do it'a milion percent. He reiterated his claims of being sexually abused. He had described toa numberof psychiatrists since his arrest in May 2008 that he was suffering from hallucinations, but these were not regarded 22 symptoms ofa paychotc disorder, but consistent with some form of personality disorder. He had been prescribed and was taking a modest dose of antidepressant medication and alow dose of Quetiapne, used an anxiotic and mood stabiliser. The last sentence the cinial review read: To cscuss withthe Governor on the management of ick once he Is wansterred autide the Heath wing An ACCT had been opened again on Sth September and there had been a numberof case reviews (13.9.12, 20.9.2, 269.12 x2, 1.10.12, 810,42, 27.10.12, 6.11.12, 20.11.12 and 6.12.12). He had not wished io leave the HCC and had threatened to harm rims should that happon. Folowing the assossment by the paychiatit on 27th November 2012, he was not seen again by any Psychiatrist up unt and including 6th December 2012. On that day, he had a case review in the HCC, which was not tended by any Psychiatrist, or anyone trom the Mental Heath in-reach Team, The rsk this slf harm or suid waa rogarded as raised and the summary ofthe review said that there had been previous discussions wit two previous psyehatists But tere was no cincal reason for him to remas in the HCC. These peychatric contacts were especavely at the last review in November and involved another Consutant Peychiatrit who only made one clinical enty in late October 2012 Tia was moan fo S00 a Peychiatiat within wo weaks of hia move a an ordinary wing location and that he MHIT was tasked fo follow up on him. An MIT referral was duly made and he was placed on the wang Ist. However, by 13th December, he had not Seen the Psychiat or ndeed anyoody trom the MIT. úTho recording of his ACCT required interactions and observations was far trom clear and several witnesses repored ferent understandings of what the requirements were. Itwas believed that proro im leaving the HCC on 6th December 2012, he was eccupying a non-safer coll having been moved there from a safer col after a period of tino but K was not possible to determine how long thi had been the poston. Unfortunately this was another factor the clinical reviewer was unaware of unit giving evidence, Upon his transfer to C-wing, the staff there did not know of approciat thal he was regarded as sutfenng trom mental sorder (potentialy some form of personalty <order (of what ever type ) and also PTSD and a depressive daorder) Furthermore he Senior Oicer who attended this case review dia not recal thal the deceased had threatened todo something io himself he wore moved athough this was leary documented and another senior Nurse who attended ts meeting ea thal s what happened. In addtion the Senior Oticer was unaware ofthe deceased's drect threat of suicde made on the 27 November 2012 but had she been tod this would have prompted her to query # C wing was the ight location for he deceased. It seems that just belore his move to C-wing, he was subject to tree daly interactions and three nightly observations. C-wing de not have any safer or CCTV monitored cols. He also had a Cell Sharng Fisk Assessment which meant he had to occupy a cel lone. Upon his transfert appeared that the numberof daly interactions incroased to 5, andthe right time observations were 4. He was only on the wing afew days and Kept himself very much fo hime. He spent long periods of time in hs cel, although he was on the outer part of he wing and could have spent more me out of his cell. He oi get @ Job as a wing painter. No specfic officer on duty was allocated to do the ACCT checks uring he daytime and on the 8th, Sth and 10th December from about 07.00 unit midday, there was no recorded checks a all. He was soen before O9.00hrs on 11%, land dd allend an ACCT review, which took place later that moming Amember ofthe MHIT was contacted by phone, but never attended in person. No Psychiatrist was in attendance, nor any member ofthe MHIT who had Knowledge of him, He presented to the Senior Officer leading the case review as improved. His love! of dally intecactons appeared tobe reduced to 4, rom 5. The fllowing day on 12! December, again he was not subject to any checks in the moming from O7.00hrs unt smidsay. (On 13th December, ance again there were no checks on him after about 07.00hrs unt he was found in hs cel at about 12.20hrs. When his cell had been opened up that morning, even though he was subject to ACCT procedures, the aticer doing so never went ino the cello check that no was stil alive and well The evidence demonstrated Clearly hat tis should have takan piace, and that he should have been subject to one or mare contacts during the momning before lunchtime, in view ofthe fac hat he was on an ACCT. The medical evidence established that he ded some hours belore he was ound, and it must have been ater his last observation when he was seen in his cll asleep at about 07 00hrs that morning. The cinical reviewer pointed out thatthe assessment of risk was a complicated procoss and that he regarded the deceased as presenting a chronic but fuctusing sk. Events {and circumstances could resutin the risk being igh. The guidance factors included wah the standard pried ACCT forms wero very far trom being the representing the whole assessment. It isnot in any senso a tick box exercise. The deceased was being transferred trom the HCC where he was stable. He had made direct (atthe review on the 27 November 2012 ) and indirect (at the case review on the 6 December 2012) threats of se harm and sulcde he was moved. He was not wiling 1 40 ths. The cinical reviewer tld the cout that he had not been sent by these who instructed im a number of signiicant interviews (5 in total) but he also clamed to have received an interview record from a Nurse whose interview was rot included at al as an annex to the fina report. On the 9 March 2015 the PPO supplied this extra inorvew and ok the court hat ithad been omitied in eror and tis had not bean picked Up. The cinical reviewer was an experienced practioner who told the cour that his pinion the risk that the deceased presented had been underestimated atthe time of his transfer. Consideration of him being managed on an ordinary wing subject io an ACCT but also withthe benef of using a safer cell andor a CCTV monitored eel wih increased observations and contacts atleast for a period of ime would have boon appropriate. However. on C wing there were no safer or cols with CCTV monitoring cities, It required a graduated stop down from how he was being cared for onthe HCC. It id not seem that there was any interim or half way house om the HOC to an ordinary wing location, úThe cinial reviewer agreed that there was prevalence of prisoners who suffered from a personality disorders) or tats of such. Thee were very few spectic treatment unis within he prison system. The court was told that at he tme tere were ony a few safer els on a very limited numberof other wings. including the segregation unk. which would not have been regarded asa sutable location forthe ceased in any event. There wore a very limited numberof cols that had CCTV cameras istatod but that folowing & fatality in 20011 at HMP Manchester (involng Anthony Raymond Gilad whose inquest the cour deat within late 2014 ) CCTV manitorng was no longer being catiod ut as par of any observation regme. The court was told that his was because the MPS guidance was that if CCTV montoring was o be used then the cameras has to be continuously monitored 24 hours a day. This was an Ise raised by the cour following the inquest and concidentally reps to a formal Regulation 28 PFO report and letter of concer were received just Before the end ofthe inquest Into be death of Mr Ball. úThe court was told that there was special intervention unit which could house up toS prisoners and had a safer cebu his was national facity and not iocaly controlled and was reserved for those prisoners whose behaviour was quite extreme, úThe cinical reviewer noted that there was no documented consideration of whether or ot the deceased could have been transfered oa mental health hospal or unit outside the HMPS estate for futher assessment andr treatment under the provisions of he Mental Heath Act. Whist ft was recognised tha his was fa rom a straight forward procedure t may resultin a contimed or atered agnosis and a better formulated freatment and management plan CORONER'S CONCERNS During te course ofthe Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ise to concer. In my opnion there isa rsk tha future deaths wil occur unless action is taken. in the Grcumstances its my statutory dy to repor to you, The MATTERS OF CONCERN ave as fotows: NHS England Commissioners 1. The evidence established a sigcant unmet need for psychological therapios to treat patient prisoner suffering from personaity diserders or hase eullerng trom traits of such personaly orders. These prisoners are recognised as being at higher risk of selfharm (which may uttmaelyresut in death) of suicide, Without NHS Commissioners allocating more resources to Identfying and eating such patients thre isa concem that further prisoners efleving om These conditions wil end up deibeaioly or aacldertally Kling hemeaWves. MHSC and HMPS localy at HMP Manchester 2 | am concerned thatthe appropriate sharing of information relating orsk and Suledal or sof harming benaviout didnot take place between the cinical eam and HMPS staf. For example, the drect threat of suicide made a he review on the 27 November 2012 was not closed to HMPS stall. Appropriate, tly mutual iformaton exchange had not taken place and there a concern that this may be vital ut may be overlooked if stops are not aken to make this & matter of routine. It means that cinical staff have tobe able to review the cinial record approprately and share information with their HMPS colleagues, | am concerned atthe lack of attendance of the Consultant Psychiatrist or a Suitably qualtied and experenced junior coleague atthe discrarge case eview/meating. In a.case of patent sil on an ACCT and being discharged to {an ordinary wing locason witout as senor cinician being able to attend and Participate in the discharge case review , risk assessment at hat stage and risk Planning. n this ease tere was no attendance on the 6 December 2012 and no clinican had seen him since 27 November 2012. This would alow a more Sophisticated and timely assessment of risk at atime. Measures to try and reduce or mitigate the sks could then be discussed and put n place n'a Graduated manner. I's appreciaed that such case reviews may have fo be rearranged so as to facta ful attondance. The cout has previously identified the concem arising from that fact that no senior elncian took the opportunity at he appropriate ime to stand back and take an overall view of he entire circumstances and the risks presented. | am concemed by the lack of planning or consideration ofa graduated risk management plan in such crcumstances. This was denified by he clinical eviewor. In other words increased frequency of day time interactions and throughout the whole day and KIT and Psychiatrist contacts very shorty ater the move.

In my opnion there isa rsk tha future deaths wil occur unless action is taken. in the Grcumstances its my statutory dy to repor to you, The MATTERS OF CONCERN ave as fotows: NHS England Commissioners 1. The evidence established a sigcant unmet need for psychological therapios to treat patient prisoner suffering from personaity diserders or hase eullerng trom traits of such personaly orders. These prisoners are recognised as being at higher risk of selfharm (which may uttmaelyresut in death) of suicide, Without NHS Commissioners allocating more resources to Identfying and eating such patients thre isa concem that further prisoners efleving om These conditions wil end up deibeaioly or aacldertally Kling hemeaWves. MHSC and HMPS localy at HMP Manchester 2 | am concerned thatthe appropriate sharing of information relating orsk and Suledal or sof harming benaviout didnot take place between the cinical eam and HMPS staf. For example, the drect threat of suicide made a he review on the 27 November 2012 was not closed to HMPS stall. Appropriate, tly mutual iformaton exchange had not taken place and there a concern that this may be vital ut may be overlooked if stops are not aken to make this & matter of routine. It means that cinical staff have tobe able to review the cinial record approprately and share information with their HMPS colleagues, | am concerned atthe lack of attendance of the Consultant Psychiatrist or a Suitably qualtied and experenced junior coleague atthe discrarge case eview/meating.

This would alow a more Sophisticated and timely assessment of risk at atime. Measures to try and reduce or mitigate the sks could then be discussed and put n place n'a Graduated manner. I's appreciaed that such case reviews may have fo be rearranged so as to facta ful attondance. The cout has previously identified the concem arising from that fact that no senior elncian took the opportunity at he appropriate ime to stand back and take an overall view of he entire circumstances and the risks presented. | am concemed by the lack of planning or consideration ofa graduated risk management plan in such crcumstances.

Berrywood Hospital 1 2 CORONER I am Belinda Cheney, Assistant Coroner for Northampton. CORONERôS LEGAL POWERS I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013. 3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST I conducted three inquests into deaths that occurred in Berrywood Hospital and in two of them the concerns were similar so I have written this report to cover both deaths. On Wednesday 4th September 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jane Marie Clark whose date of birth was 20th July.1989 The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20th January 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was The medical cause of death was: 1a hanging The narrative conclusion was: Jane Marie Clark was an informal patient at Berrywood Hospital Northampton diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder. On 22nd August 2013 staff became aware that Jane had been involved in discussions about suicide with other patients. At 07.00 hours she was found in possession of a ligature. Around 09.30 hours she was granted leave from the ward without an adequate assessment of the risks. She went to the woods and tied a ligature, intending to commit suicide. She was found deceased by a passerby at 13.40 hours. Life was finally pronounced extinct at 14.32 hours. On Wednesday 28th August 2013 I commenced an investigation into the death of Isobel Griffin whose date of birth was 6th September 1956. The investigation concluded on 23rd January 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was: The medical cause of death 1a hypoxic brain injury b hanging 2 psychiatric illness The conclusion was a short form with additional comment as follows Suicide ì contributed to by inconsistent community care and difficulties in treating her mental disorder in the period from 2011ê 2013, and lack of adequate risk assessments and a well formulated management plan on the final admission between 1 and 17 August 2013. 4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH Jane Marie Clark Jane Clark had a very long standing history of personality disorder and multiple lengthy inpatient admissions. There were no issues with her care in hospital but rather that a nurse granted leave without apparently reading the notes which made clear that events in the last 12 hours (including Mrs Griffinôs death some days earlier on the ward, discussions between patients about suicide, to which discussions Jane was central, attempts by others to tie ligatures on the ward in the early hours of 22nd August, Jane being found in possession of a ligature on the morning of the 22nd) required a full risk assessment and prompt escalation to the multi disciplinary team before any decision was made about leave. The risk assessment documents had further not been updated. Further, no boundaries were placed on the leave. Isobel Griffin had been Mrs Griffinôs psychiatrist for many years. When retired in 2011 Mrs Griffin was seen by a number of different junior doctors in the community and frequent changes were made to her medication. She had a number of admissions to the Welland Centre and her diagnosis was changed from recurrent depressive disorder to personality disorder. On 27 July Mrs Griffin was discharged from the Welland Centre against the wishes of her family. On 28 July she attempted to take her life and was readmitted to the Welland Centre and at the request of her family transferred to Berrywood Hospital Northampton from 1ê17 August 2013. She was commenced on a medication free trial. She was documented as being very suicidal in the days leading to her death and from 7th August started confiding about attempts to tie ligatures which was a new development. On 17 August around 8.30 am she hanged herself from her bedroom door on the ward with a ligature made from a bathrobe cord and a sweater. Despite efforts to resuscitate her, Mrs Griffin died on 21 August at Northampton General Hospital. 5 CORONERôS CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ì Re Jane Marie Clark 1. The very challenging events of the previous evening and that morning do not appear to have been handed over and the nurse in charge did not read the notes before granting leave. Her risk assessment then was ill informed. It was not discussed with anyone nor properly documented. 2. She did not place any boundaries on the leave for example providing a time by which Jane was to return. 3. Risk assessment documentation generally was poor and appeared perfunctory. Re Isobel Griffin 1. Mrs Griffin was admitted on 1 August and was not allocated a key worker until 8th August. The key worker did not read the notes so was not aware of the events of the 7th. 2. The risk assessment was not updated with the events of the 7th. 3. Mrs Griffinôs responsible clinician saw her on only one occasion on 14 August 2013 at which time he did not read the notes so he was unaware of events on the 7th when she handed in a belt and scissors and said she had 3ê4 times tried to hang herself using a ligature. 4. A planned review of medication, diagnosis and treatment never took place despite a number of references in the notes to it from 6 August 2013. Mrs Griffin had been substantially unmedicated for most of the admission despite concerns expressed by her family. 5. On 11 August Mrs Griffin started to express thoughts to harm others. These thoughts distressed her. She did not intend to act on them but they were something new and a measure of her distress. These thoughts and their significance were not included in any risk assessment. 6. A risk assessment concluded on the 18th, the day after she had hanged herself on the ward, purports to be made with her agreement. It was evidence that risk assessment documentation is cut and pasted rather than reflecting the true circumstances. 7. The doors do not appear to be ligature proof and little was made available by way of evidence as to what measures would now be taken to minimise this risk. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 9th April 2015. I, the Assistant Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons, namely the families of both Jane Clark and Isobel Griffin. Similarly, you are under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response. 9 DATE SIGNED BY ASSISTANT CORONER 12.2.15 Belinda Cheney","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.
